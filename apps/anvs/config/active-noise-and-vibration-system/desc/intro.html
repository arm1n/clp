<p><strong>ACTIVE NOISE & VIBRATION SYSTEM</strong></p>

<p>The Active Noise and Vibration System (ANVS) decreases the noise level in the passenger cabin caused by the aircraft propellers. The system supplies secondary noise and vibrations in the passenger compartment. These secondary noise and vibrations field cancel the primary noise and vibration field. The primary and secondary noise and vibration field mix to produce lower cabin noise and vibrations.</p>

<p>The ANVS goes into the control mode when the aircraft is in flight. The system clears when the Weight-On-Wheels (WOW) input shows that the aircraft is on the ground.</p>
