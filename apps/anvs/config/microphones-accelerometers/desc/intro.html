<p><strong>Sensors − Microphones</strong></p>

<p>Miniature electric microphones connected to interface circuitry are encapsulated in sealed molded enclosures. Each enclosure is attached to a trim panel through a mounting plate and gasket on the side wall, ceiling panel and overhead storage bins.</p>

<p>There are 25 microphones installed on the side wall, 13 microphones installed on ceiling panel and 42 microphones installed on overhead storage bins.</p>

<p>The controller supplies a bias voltage of 22 to 28 V dc to each microphone through a twisted pair cable. The microphone output signals are sent back to the controller superimposed on the bias voltage.</p>

<p><strong>Sensors − Accelerometers</strong></p>

<p>The accelerometers used in the ANVS are small piezo electric sensors. The sensors are connected to interface circuitry and contained in sealed metal enclosures. Each enclosure is held in position with a bracket installed on the seat rail at stations LHS X 176 and X 236 and RHS X 204 and X 301.</p>

<p>The controller supplies a bias voltage of 22 to 28 V dc to each accelerometer through a twisted pair cable. The accelerometer output signals are sent back to the controller superimposed on the bias voltage.</p>
