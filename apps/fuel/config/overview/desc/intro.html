<p><strong>FUEL SYSTEM</strong></p>

<p>Fuel is contained in two integral main wing tanks designated No.1 (Left) and No.2 (Right). Each wing tank includes a surge bay and a collector bay. The left tank supplies fuel to the left engine and the optional Auxiliary Power Unit (APU). The right tank supplies fuel to the right engine.There are three drain valves located at the low points of each tank to permit checks for water accumulation and to drain residual fuel from the tanks when required.</p>


<p>Normal engine feed is by means of an ejector pump in each collector bay. The engine Fuel Metering Unit (FMU) supplies the motive flow. No electrical power is required for normal engine feed operation. In the event of an ejector pump failure, the auxiliary AC electrical pump in the collector bay is selected ON to supply engine fuel feed. Four scavenge ejector pumps transfer fuel inboard to the collector bay. 
This maintains a constant level in the collector bay to ensure engine fuel feed regardless of aircraft attitude and minimizes the quantity of unusable fuel. </p>

<p>A low fuel level sensor is located in each collector bay to provide a caution indication to the crew. Pressure refueling and defueling is accomplished through a single point refuel/defuel adaptor located in the right engine nacelle and is controlled through an adjacent refuel/defuel control panel. Both automatic and manual refueling modes are possible.</p>

<p>Selected and actual fuel tank quantities are displayed on the control panel. The Fuel 
Quantity Computer (FQC), located under the centre aisle floorboards, controls the 
logic during the automatic refuel/defuel process. Refuel operations can be accomplished 
using aircraft battery power. A high level sensor shutoff system ensures the maximum 
allowable tank capacity is not exceeded. As an alternative to pressure refueling and 
defueling, each tank can be filled through an overwing filler point or drained through a 
fitting installed in the auxiliary pump canister when its element is removed.</p>
