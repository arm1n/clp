<p><strong>VENT SYSTEM</strong></p>

<p>The vent system lets air enter the fuel tanks as the fuel is supplied to the engines, or during aircraft defueling.
This <clp-text-blue>prevents structural damage to the tanks</clp-text-blue> from an excessively low internal pressure. The vents also let air out of the tanks when the aircraft is being refuelled to prevent the tanks from overpressurizing.</p>
