<p><strong>INDICATION</strong></p>

<p>The fuel indicating system supplies <clp-text-blue>information on fuel quantity, low level detection and fuel temperature</clp-text-blue> for display in the flight compartment. Fuel quantity is also shown on the refuel/defuel control panel.
The fuel indicating system provides an accurate measure of the fuel quantity in the wing tanks. Nine DC capacitance type fuel probes located in each wing send inputs to the Fuel Quantity Computer (FQC) 
to calculate the aircraft fuel quantity.</p>

<p>The Engine Indicating System <b>(EIS)</b> in the flight compartment <clp-text-blue>displays the fuel quantity</clp-text-blue> information to the flight crew. The fuel quantity information is also displayed 
on the Refuel/Defuel Indicator (RDI) located in the refuel/defuel panel.
A magnastick located in each wing provides an independent mechanical indication of fuel tank quantity.
</p>

<p>Low fuel level is sensed by a float switch in <b>each collector bay</b> and is indicated by a caution light on the Caution and Warning Panel. <b>Fuel tank temperature</b> is measured by a Resistance Temperature Device <b>(RTD)</b> sensor in the <b>left collector bay</b> and is displayed in the flight compartment.</p>
