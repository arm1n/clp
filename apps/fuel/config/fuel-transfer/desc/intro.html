<p><strong>FUEL TRANSFER</strong></p>

<p>The fuel transfer system moves fuel from one tank to the other to <clp-text-blue>correct fuel imbalances or for fuel management.</clp-text-blue> 
The system can <clp-text-blue>empty one fuel tank for maintenance</clp-text-blue> without defueling the aircraft.</p>

<p>Fuel can be transferred when the aircraft is in the air or on the ground. Fuel transfer is controlled through the <b>FUEL CONTROL TRANSFER</b> panel. The fuel transfer system shares some of its components 
with the refuel/defuel system. Fuel transfer cannot occur during the refuel/defuel process. The fuel transfer system uses the auxiliary pump, part of the engine feed system, and the refuel/defuel/transfer
manifold. </p>

<p>Fuel transfer data is shown in the flight compartment.</p>
