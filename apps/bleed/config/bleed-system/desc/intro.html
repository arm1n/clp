		<p>The air conditioning pack conditions the bleed air to the proper temperature and humidity and delivers it to the air distribution system for environmental control of the cabin and flight deck.</p>

		<p>The air conditioning pack is part of the Environmental Control System (ECS). It uses bleed air from the engines or Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) to supply conditioned air to the cabin and flight deck.</p>

		<p>Two air cycle machines (ACM), are integrated with a single primary heat exchanger and a sin- gle secondary heat exchanger. They are located in the aft fuselage (aft equipment bay), and cool the hot bleed air coming from the two engines or from the APU. This configuration pro- vides the redundancy of two packs while allowing access to a much larger dual heat exchanger during operation with a single ACM.</p>

		<p><strong>Ground Air Conditioning Connection</strong></p>
		<p>The ECS Ground Air connection is located low down on the Aft fuselage on the right hand side of the aeroplane. It is protected by a latched door, which when open allows an industry standard “8” diameter supply to be connected to the aeroplane.</p>

		<p>From the connection the ground supplied air is ducted inboard and utilizes the aeroplane air distribution system to either heat or cool the aeroplane. To prevent loss of aeroplane pressure when the aeroplane is operating pressurized a flapper style check valve, situated at the junc- tion to the distribution system prevents reverse flow and loss of cabin pressure.</p>

	<clp-tab name="PNEUMATICS">

		<p><strong>Pneumatics</strong></p>
		<p>Bleed air for the pneumatic systems can be supplied by the engines or by an optional Auxiliary Power Unit (APU). The APU supplies the system with bleed air prior to engine start. The engines supply bleed air for pneumatics after engine start.</p>

		<p><b>The following systems use pneumatics for operation:</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Air conditioning and pressurization</li>
			<li>Airframe deicing</li>
			<li>Airstair door seal pressurization</li>
			<li>Engine Oil Cooling ejection system</li>
		</ul>

		<p><b>The following systems use pneumatics for operation:</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Air conditioning</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<p>Bleed air operation from the left and right engines are similar. Compressed Bleed air is ducted from the Low Pressure (LP) compressor port, or the High Pressure (HP) compressor port of each engine. Power lever position and the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) determine whether the HP port or the LP port will be used, when bleeds are selected ON.</p>

		<p>Bleed air for airframe deicing, is supplied through the HP or LP bleed air port and passes through the deice section of the precooler. This protects the components of the deice system from overheating. When bleeds are selected OFF, or when de-ice is selected ON a pressure switch determines if the HP or the LP port is ON.</p>

		<p>Selection of one of the two BLEED Control switches on the AIR CONDITIONING control panel to BLEED 1 and/or 2, turns on the related engine bleed air system. Two PACKS switches, labeled OFF/MAN/AUTO, and a single rotary BLEED control selector also control bleed air flow. Together they regulate the quantity of air flowing into the system. Selec- tion of the bleed air (BL AIR) switchlight on the APU CONTROL panel turns on the APU bleed air.</p>

		<p>If an overtemperature, overpressure, or duct leak occurs, the ECU automatically shuts down the bleed air system.</p>
