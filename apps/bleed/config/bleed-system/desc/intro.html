<br>
<p>Bleed air for the pneumatic systems is supplied by the engines or by an optional Auxiliary Power Unit (APU). The APU supplies the ECS with bleed air before engine start. The engines normally supply bleed air for pneumatics after engine start.</p>
<p>The Bleed Air System (BAS), is part of the Environmental Control Sys- tem (ECS) which supplies conditioned air to the flight and cabin com- partments.
	Bleed air flows through ducts from each engine along the wing forward spar, through the dorsal fin then to the air conditioning pack.</p>
<p>The left digital channel of the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) controls the bleed air system of No.1 engine, and the right digital channel controls the bleed air system of No.2 engine. The left and right digital channels each have analog channel backup. If a digital channel fails, the related analog channel will control that system.</p>

<p>The ECU uses a differential pressure (flow) sensor to measure the bleed air flow through each Nacelle Shut-Off Valve (NSOV).</p>
<p>The ECU uses this bleed airflow data to balance the flow of bleed air from both engines to the ECS.</p>
<p>Each digital channel modulates its Nacelle Flow Control and Shut-off Valve (NFCSOV) to maintain 50% total bleed air flow from its engine. Bleed air sharing can occur only when both engines are in operation and both digital channels are functional.</p>

<p><strong>Air Conditioning</strong></p>

<p>The air conditioning pack supplies the flight compartment and cabin air distribution systems with conditioned air. The conditioned air is used for cabin and flight compartment heating, cooling, ventilation and pres- surization.</p>

<p>The air conditioning system takes bleed air from each engine and deliv- ers it to one integrated pack containing two Air Cycle Machines (ACM), distribution and recirculation air systems. Air required to operate the system is supplied by each engine from high or low pressure bleed ports. On aircraft equipped with an Auxiliary Power Unit (APU), bleed air is available from the APU when the aircraft is on the ground. An optional ground air conditioning connection is available to supply conditioned air from a ground source.</p>

<p>Conditioned air is supplied to the cabin through upper and lower vents in the ceiling and sidewalls. The recirculation system draws air from the cabin zone and routes it back to the mixer, where it is mixed with air discharged from the Air Cycle Machines. The conditioned air from the ACM pressurizes the aircraft. Pressuriza- tion is controlled by regulating the amount of air leaving the aircraft.</p>
