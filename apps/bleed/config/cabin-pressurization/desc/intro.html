<p><strong>PRESSURIZATION CONTROL</strong></p>

<p>The pressurized area of the fuselage extends from the front pressure bulkhead immediately forward of the windshield at aircraft station X 111 to the rear dome at Sta X 856. This area includes the flight compartment, passenger compartment, under floor space and baggage compartment. <br>
The Cabin Pressure Control Panel controls the system in automatic and manual modes. The Cabin Indication Module shows the data to monitor the system.</p>

<p>When cabin altitude is too high, the cabin pressure and the cabin indication module send the warning signal to the aircraft systems.</p>
