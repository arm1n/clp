<p><strong>PRESENT FAULTS (ECS Page 1 - 2)</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Any fault that is currently stored in RAM</li>
	<li>Present faults are also stored in NVM as soon as they occur</li>
	<li>If a present fault happens more than once in a power cycle, only the first occurrence will be stored in NVM</li>
	<li>Maintenance personnel has the ability to clear the present faults for troubleshooting purposes</li>
	<li>Present fault becomes a historical fault once it has been cleared from RAM</li>
</ul>

<p><clp-text-blue><strong>NOTE:</strong> Use PRESENT faults and FIM tasks for troubleshooting</clp-text-blue></p>

<p><strong>Clear PRESENT</strong> fault and perform AMM system check-out procedure If fault does not repeat, take no further action and monitor for recurrence If fault repeats, follow FIM task and replace component</p>

<p>
	<clp-text-blue><strong>Not all logged faults require a maintenance action.</strong></clp-text-blue> Some faults are set on-condition when system/engine performance may temporarily exceed established limits.
</p>

<p>Also on power-up, a valveâ€™s position switch may be in the incorrect state due to the last system shutdown sequence.</p>

<p>These type of faults typically do not repeat over subsequent flights</p>
