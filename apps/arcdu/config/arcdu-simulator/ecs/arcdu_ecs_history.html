<p><strong>HISTORY FAULTS (ECS Page 3 - 4)</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Same information as the present fault pages except for the time since last</li>
	<li>reset as a 3 digit decimal number attached to the end of each data line</li>
	<li>Time since last reset is in hours and derived by subtracting the time of the fault from the current elapsed time</li>
	<li>Last 12 faults are displayed on the history page</li>
	<li>Last 30 faults are stored in NVM</li>
</ul>

<clp-text-blue><strong>NOTE:</strong> PRESENT FAULTS will clear and roll-over to HISTORY page when either the NVM reset button (on the Central Maintenance Panel) is depressed or power is reset</clp-text-blue>
<p><strong>If PRESENT</strong> faults cleared, and not recorded (at gate), 
link earliest HISTORY faults to the symptom and use 
FIM tasks for T/S</p>

<p><clp-text-blue><strong>Not all logged faults require a maintenance action</strong></clp-text-blue> Some faults are set on-condition when system/engine performance may temporarily exceed established limits.</p>

<p>Also on power-up, a valveâ€™s position switch may be in the incorrect state due to the last system shutdown sequence
</p>

<p>These type of faults typically do not repeat over subsequent flights</p>
