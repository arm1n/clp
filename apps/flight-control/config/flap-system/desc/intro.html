<p><strong>FLAP SYSTEM</strong></p>

<p>The wing flaps supply increased lift during take-off and landing. Each wing has an inboard and an outboard flap surface. Indication of flap position is given by an indicator on the copilot's Multi Function Display. The flap surfaces are electronically controlled and hydraulically
operated. </p>

<p>The flaps are extended when the flap lever is moved in its quadrant. The flap quadrant has five positions corresponding to the five possible flap positions: 0°, 5°, 10°, 15° and 35°.</p>

<p>The flap control system is an electronically controlled, hydro-mechanical system. It monitors flap position and selection signals and produces the output signals to the Flap Power Unit
(FPU) to control flap movement.</p>
