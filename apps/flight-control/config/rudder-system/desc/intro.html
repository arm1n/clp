<p>The rudder control system is a primary flight control system. It supplies directional control of the aircraft about the yaw (normal) axis during flight.</p>

<p>The rudder system transmits the yaw commands from the pilot's and copilot's rudder pedals to the rudder through a series of quadrants, cables, levers and pushrods. Movement of the rudder pedals is transmitted to two hydraulic Power Control Units (PCUs).</p>

<p>move the rudder in proportion to the amount of rudder pedal input. The rudder system also has inputs from the Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS) and the rudder trim actuator.</p>
