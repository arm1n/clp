<p><strong>AILERON SYSTEM</strong></p>

<p>The aileron control system is a primary flight control system. The ailerons, assisted by the spoilers, give roll control (lateral control) of the aircraft in flight.</p>

<p>The ailerons give roll control of the aircraft in flight. The pilot or copilot supplies roll commands to the aileron control system by turning the handwheels. Roll input commands are mechanically transmitted from the pilot's and copilot's handwheels to the aileron
surfaces through the aileron control system.</p>

<p>The aileron system also has inputs from the Auto Flight Control System (AFCS) and the Aileron Trim and Centering Unit. The Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS) also gives roll commands,
through the autopilot servo connected to the aileron forward quadrant located below the flight compartment floor.</p>
