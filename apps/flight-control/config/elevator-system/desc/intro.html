<p><strong>ELEVATOR SYSTEM</strong></p>

<p>The elevator control system is a primary flight control system which supplies longitudinal (pitch) control of the aircraft during takeoff, flight and landing. The elevator system transmits the pitch commands from the pilot's and copilot's control columns to the elevator control surfaces. The elevator surfaces move in proportion to the amount of control column movement.</p>

<p>The elevators are moved down to pitch the aircraft nose down and moved up to pitch the aircraft nose up, around the lateral axis. The elevators are positioned by commands from either the pilot control system or the Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS).</p>

<p>Trim control and surface position indication is also supplied for each elevator. Trimming of the elevator control system gives the aircraft longitudinal stability during flight. Trimming counters the effects of changes to the aircraft centre of gravity, airspeed and lift during flap extension or retraction.</p>

<p>There are three identical hydraulic PCUs (outboard, centre and inboard) on each elevator. The outboard and centre PCUs on each elevator are active at all times while the inboard PCU is on standby.<br> The No.1 hydraulic system supplies power to the left and right outboard PCUs. The No.2 hydraulic system supplies power to the left and right centre PCUs. The standby No.3 hydraulic system supplies power to the left and right inboard standby PCUs. A switch labelled
STBY HYD PRESS in the flight compartment activates the inboard
PCUs</p>
