<p><strong>Flight Control Electronic Control Unit (FCECU)</strong></p>

<p>The Flight Control Electronic Control Unit (FCECU) receiveselectrical/electronic inputs and supplies electrical/electronic outputs,for all of the primary and secondary flight control systems.The FCECU is a single unit divided into two channels, 1 and 2, (alsoreferred to as the left and right channels). The left and right channelsreceive inputs from the pilot and/or copilot flight control commands. The two channels function separately from each other throughout theentire system, from the FCECU to the individual Line ReplaceableUnits (LRUs) and electrical busses.</p>
