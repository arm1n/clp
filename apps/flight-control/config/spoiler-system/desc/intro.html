<p><strong>SPOILER SYSTEM</strong></p>

<p>The roll spoilers are a secondary flight control system. They are hydraulically powered and operate with the aileron control system to give lateral control of the aircraft in flight. The roll spoilers also decrease the lift made by the wings after the aircraft has landed.
The Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS) can also operate the spoiler control system through the autopilot servo. </p>

<p>There are two hydraulically powered roll spoilers on each wing. The No.1 hydraulic system supplies power to operate the inboard spoilers and the No.2 hydraulic system powers the outboard spoilers.The ailerons and the roll spoilers can be disconnected from each other if a jam occurs in either system. There are three modes of spoiler operation: Flight Mode, Ground Mode, and Taxi Mode.</p>

<div><b>Flight mode: </b></div>
<p>The spoiler panels respond to the inputs from the control handwheels or from the autopilot. At airspeeds less than 170 kt (315 km/h), both the inboard and outboard spoilers are operational. At airspeeds greater than 170kt (315 km/h), the Flight Control Electronic Control Unit (FCECU) locks out the outboard spoilers. The inboard spoilers remain operational at all airspeeds.</p>
<br>
<div><b>Ground Mode: </b></div>
<p>With the engine power levers at or below flight idle plus 12 degrees and the two Weight-On-Wheels signals (WOW1 and WOW2) supplied from the Proximity Sensor Electronic Unit (PSEU), the FCECU energizes all the lift dump valves. All four spoiler panels will fully extend and the lift made by the wings will decrease. The FLIGHT/TAXI switch must be in the FLIGHT position.</p>
<br>
<div><b>Flight mode: </b></div>
<p>With all the conditions identical to the ground mode and the FLIGHT/TAXI switch set to TAXI; the four spoiler panels will fully retract.</p>
