		<clp-td>The CAWP FLAP POWER caution light is latched on and no more flap movement is possible when the flap control unit (FCU) senses a condition that follows:

			<ul>
				<li>Flap asymmetry</li>
				<li>Uncommanded movement </li>
				<li>A position transducer has malfunctioned</li>
				<li>The flap lever transducer has malfunctioned</li>
				<li>The arming switch has malfunctioned</li>
				<li>The FCU has malfunctioned</li>
			</ul>

			<div>There are two possible conditions that can cause the FLAP POWER caution light to come on as nuisance fault:</div>

			<ul>
				<li>The FLAP POWER caution light will come on if you move the flap control lever to a different position and there is no pressure in the No. 1 hydraulic system for six seconds.</li>
				<li>The FLAP POWER caution light will come on if you move the flap control lever to a different position and the release trigger does not go to the bottom of the detent for 10 seconds.</li>

		<clp-td>The CAWP FLAP DRIVE caution light comes on when the flap control unit (FCU) senses a condition that follows:
			<ul>
				<li>Hydraulic pressure is sensed with no flap selection (the shut−off valve stays open after the flap movement is completed)</li>
				<li>The flap panels have stopped moving (stalled) before reaching the set position (a difference between flap position selection and flap position indication is sensed)</li>
				<li>The FCU has malfunctioned.</li>
			</ul>
			<clp-text-blue><strong>NOTE:</strong> The flap system will continue to operate in a degraded mode when the FLAP.</clp-text-blue>

		<clp-td> If hydraulic failure does occur (>350 psi), the related No. 1 RUD HYD or No.2 RUD HYD caution light comes on.These caution lights also come on if the FCECU has shut down one of the hydraulic systems due to valve malfunction or if either RUD 1 or RUD 2 switchlight is pushed.</clp-td>

				<li>FCECU detects a difference of 20 knots (37.06 km/h) or more between the Airspeed 1 and Airspeed 2 from the Air Data Units</li>
