    <p>This fault code is generated as a result of a mismatch between the UPTRIM command and the electrical state of the UPTRIM discrete from Channel A of the local PEC to the opposite side FADEC.</p><!-- !!!! -->

    <p>The fault logic has determined that, for a period of 1 second either:
        – an uptrim signal logic has been sent by PEC Channel A to the opposite powerplant when required, or
        – an uptrim signal has not been sent by Channel B to the opposite powerplant when required.</p><!-- !!!! -->

    <p>This fault code will inhibit the autofeather advisory when PLA goes into the take−off range. There is no impact on TLD. This fault is typically annunciated during the take−off roll, which will result in an aborted take−off.</p><!-- !!!! -->

    <p>This fault can be triggered if the discrete wire between the PEC Channel B and the opposite side FADEC is shorted to ground or shield. The opposite side FADEC may also show fault 771.</p><!-- !!!! -->
