	<p>This fault code is generated as a result of an apparent difference in Qb when compared with Qa and FADEC TORQUE.</p><!-- !!!! -->
	
	<p>The fault isolation logic has determined that Qb differs by more than 20% rated torque when compared to Qa and FADEC TORQUE. Qa and FADEC TORQUE must be within 10% rated torque of each other. This check is completed only when propeller speed is greater than 400 rpm, NP is valid and FADEC TORQUE is valid. There is a first order lag of 5 seconds before any comparison test is completed.</p><!-- !!!! -->
	
	<p>This fault code will inhibit the autofeather advisory when PLA goes into the takeâˆ’off range. This fault code is designated as no despatch for TLD purposes and therefore will also illuminate the powerplant message on the engine display.</p><!-- !!!! -->
	
	<p>During fault isolation for OSG and AF test faults, the tests must be done again after corrective action has been taken. If the tests pass, a fault clear will be necessary to clear the fault in question.</p><!-- !!!! -->
