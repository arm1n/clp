	<p>This fault code is generated as a result of the PEC indicating that the overspeed governor test or automated flight fine stop test has failed.</p><!-- !!!! -->
	
	<p>The fault accommodation logic has determined that with the indication of the governor test or automated flight fine stop test being active, the propeller speed has exceeded its limit, or that the propeller blade angle has exceeded the flight fine stop.</p><!-- !!!! -->
	
	<p>This fault code is designated as No Despatch for time limited despatch (TLD) purpose and therefore will also illuminate the powerplant message on the engine display.</p><!-- !!!! -->
	
	<p>During fault isolation for OSG and AF test faults, the test must be done again after corrective action has been taken.The test must be completed successfully.</p><!-- !!!! -->
	
    <p>Fault code 238 is non−latching and provides real time indication that the last OSG/FFS test has failed by illuminating the POWERPLANT advisory message on the engine display. A successful OSG/FFS re−test will automatically clear fault code 238 and remove the POWERPLANT advisory message. A maintenance fault clear will not clear fault code 238.</p><!-- !!!! -->
