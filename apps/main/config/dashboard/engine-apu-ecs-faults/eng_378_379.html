    <p>This fault code has been generated during beta calibration on the control lane is not in control for long enough for a calibration to be completed.</p><!-- !!!! -->

    <p>The fault isolation logic has determined that there has been insufficient time for the control lane to complete a calibration.</p><!-- !!!! -->

    <p>The fault code is advisory but will not be annunciated to the flight crew as a PEC caution. This fault code is designated as no despatch for TLD purposes and therefore will also illuminate the powerplant message on the engine display.</p><!-- !!!! -->
