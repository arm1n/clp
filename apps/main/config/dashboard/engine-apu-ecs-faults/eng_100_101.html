	<p>This fault code is generated as a result of the PEC software failing to reset the processor immediately following the writing of a mistrigger command to the watchdog. This is an internal PEC fault.</p><!-- !!!! -->
	
	<p>The fault isolation logic has determined that following the writing of a mistrigger command to the watchdog, a watchdogâˆ’fail to reset fault has been set when the processor is not reset within 0.001 ms.</p><!-- !!!! -->
	
	<p>The fault code is advisory but will not be annunciated to the flight crew as a PEC caution. This fault code is designated as No Despatch for TLD purposes and therefore will also illuminate the powerplant message on the engine display.</p><!-- !!!! -->
