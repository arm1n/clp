	<div>This fault code is generated as a result of a fault in the Random Access Memory (RAM) within the PEC. This is detected by performing a readback check of the data that has been written to the RAM. This is an internal PEC fault.</div><!-- !!!! -->
	<br>
	<div>The fault isolation logic has determined that a piece of data written to a memory location has been incorrectly read back.</div><!-- !!!! -->
	<br>
	<div>The fault code is advisory but will not be annunciated to the flight crew as a PEC caution. This fault code is designated as No Despatch for TLD purposes and therefore will also illuminate the powerplant message on the engine display.</div><!-- !!!! -->
