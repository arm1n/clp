	<p>This fault code is generated as a result of a discrepancy between demanded blade angle and the actual blade angle when the propeller is being operated in beta control mode (i.e. low PLA settings either in flight or on the ground).</p><!-- !!!! -->
	
	<p>The fault isolation logic has detected that the difference between the actual blade angle and the required blade angle is greater than 1 degree (Pre Modsum 4W113558) or 1.5 degrees (Post Modsum 4W113558) for a period of more than 30 seconds whilst the propeller is operating in beta mode.</p><!-- !!!! -->
	
	<p>The fault code is advisory but will not be annunciated to the flight crew as a PEC caution. For Pre Modsum 4W113558, this fault code is designated as no despatch for TLD purposes and therefore will also illuminate the powerplant message on the engine display. For Post Modsum 4W113558, this fault code is designated as unlimited despatch for TLD purposes, provided that repairs to correct and clear the fault are completed within 10 days of fault detection or within 150 flight hours of fault occurrence, whichever occurs later. Refer to the Continued Airworthiness Maintenance Tasks section of PMM 1096 Part 1.</p><!-- !!!! -->
