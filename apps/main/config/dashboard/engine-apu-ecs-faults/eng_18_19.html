  <div>
    This fault code is generated as a result of an apparent error in one of the control priority discretes, used to determine which PEC lane is the controlling lane. This is an internal PEC fault.<br> The fault isolation logic has determined that there is a difference between the control priority discretes supplied on the interlane bus. <br>The fault code is advisory but will not be annunciated to the flight crew as a PEC caution. This fault code is designated as No Despatch for TLD purposes and therefore will also illuminate the powerplant message on the engine display.
