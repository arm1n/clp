	<p>This task is for the Propeller Electronic Control Unit (PEC) fault code 276/277 âˆ’ Channel deselect discrete.</p><!-- !!!! -->
	
	<p>This fault code is generated as a result of an apparent deselection of an input used only for software overlay purposes. This is an internal PEC fault.</p><!-- !!!! -->
	
	<p>The fault isolation logic has determined that the software is trying to download or select overlay data.</p><!-- !!!! -->
	
	<p>The fault code is advisory but will not be annunciated to the flight crew as a PEC caution. This fault code is designated as no despatch for TLD purposes and therefore will also illuminate the powerplant message on the engine display.</p><!-- !!!! -->

	<div><b>PRE SB84-61-01</b></div>
	<p>This fault code is generated as a result of an apparent mismatch in the PEC permissions required to unfeather the propeller in maintenance mode. This is an internal PEC fault.</p>
	<p>The fault isolation logic has determined that (MANUAL UNFEATHER = on) and (MANUAL FEATHER = off) and (AF FET MON = off).</p>
	<p>The fault code is advisory but will not be annunciated to the flight crew as a PEC caution. This fault code is designated as no despatch for TLD purposes and therefore will also illuminate the powerplant message on the engine display.</p>
