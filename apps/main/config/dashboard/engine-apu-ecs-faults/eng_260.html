    <p>This fault code is generated as a result of a disagreement between servo valve torque motor demand current (the software generated drive current) and feedback current on the active lane of the PEC. This is an indication of one of problems that follow:
        – that the AUPC has been triggered
        – that there is a problem with the PCU servo valve (or the wiring to the servo valve)
        – that the PEC built−in−test has failed.
    </p><!-- !!!! -->
    
    <p>NOTE: This fault code is inhibited in the event of autofeather.</p><!-- !!!! -->
    
    <p>The fault isolation logic has determined that the torque motor current demand differs by more than 10mA from the monitored feedback current.</p><!-- !!!! -->
    
    <p>This fault code will be annunciated as a PEC caution on the ACWS. This fault code is designated as No Despatch for TLD purposes and therefore will also illuminate the powerplant message on the engine display.</p><!-- !!!! -->
    
    <p>During fault isolation for OSG and AF test faults, the tests must be done again after corrective action has been taken. If the tests pass, a fault clear will be necessary to clear the fault in question.</p><!-- !!!! -->
