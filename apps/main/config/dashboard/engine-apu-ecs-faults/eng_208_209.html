	<p>This fault code is generated as a result of an apparent indication of the PEC OSG test software driven switch not being closed as requested during an OSG test. This is an internal PEC fault.</p><!-- !!!! -->
	
	<p>The fault isolation logic has determined that, with OSG TEST REQUEST = ON, and OSG GOV RESET = 1, that OSG LOW SIDE MON = 1 (should be 0).</p><!-- !!!! -->
	
	<p>The fault code is advisory but will not be annunciated to the flight crew as a PEC caution. This fault code is designated as no despatch for TLD purposes and therefore will also illuminate the powerplant message on the engine display.</p><!-- !!!! -->
	
	<p>During fault isolation for OSG and AF test faults, the tests must be done again after corrective action has been taken. If the tests pass, a fault clear will be necessary to clear the fault in question.</p><!-- !!!! -->
