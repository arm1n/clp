	<p>This task is for fault code 210 − OSG I−Bit failure (On aircraft without Modsum 4−113264) or OSG governing fault (On aircraft with Modsum 4−113264). This fault code is generated as a result of the propeller Np increasing above 940 rpm during the OSG test. This is an indication of a hydro−mechanical problem with the OSG.</p><!-- !!!! -->
	
	<p>The fault isolation logic has determined that during the OSG test the propeller Np speed has increased above 940 rpm.</p><!-- !!!! -->
	
	<p>This fault code is advisory and will not be annunciated to the flight crew. This fault code is designated as unlimited despatch for TLD purposes.</p><!-- !!!! -->
	
	<p>During fault isolation for overspeed governor (OSG) test faults, the tests must be completed again after corrective action has been taken. If the tests pass then a fault clear will be necessary to clear the fault in question.</p><!-- !!!! -->
