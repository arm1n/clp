    <p>This fault code is generated as a result of an apparent failure to signal the AUPC trigger logic with the correct speed status. This is an indication of an internal PEC fault.</p><!-- !!!! -->
    
    <p>The fault isolation logic has determined that either of the following is true:
        AUPC THRESHOLD MONITOR is inactive (no AUPC drive signal) with NQA/NQB smaller 77% (785 rpm) or
        AUPC THRESHOLD MONITOR is active (AUPC drive signal) with NQA/NQB larger 83% (845 rpm).</p><!-- !!!! -->
    
    <p>This fault code will be annunciated as a PEC caution in the ACWS. This fault code is designated as No Despatch for TLD purposes and therefore will also illuminate the powerplant message on the engine display.</p><!-- !!!! -->
    
    <p>During fault isolation for OSG and AF test faults, the tests must be done again after corrective action has been taken. If the tests pass, a fault clear will be necessary to clear the fault in question.</p><!-- !!!! -->
