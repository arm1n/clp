    <p>Pre SB84-61-01-A:
    This fault code is generated as a result of an apparent mismatch between the feather pump demand and an indication that manual feather is not operating. This is an internal PEC fault.</p><!-- !!!! -->

    <p>The fault detection logic has determined that with the autofeather switch selected in the flight compartment, AF FET MON = On (Autofeather arm selected) and MANUAL FEATHER = Off (Not operating).</p><!-- !!!! -->
   
    <p>The fault code is advisory but will not be annunciated to the flight crew as a PEC caution. This fault code is designated as no despatch for TLD purposes and therefore will also illuminate the powerplant message on the engine display.</p><!-- !!!! -->
    
    <p>Post SB84-61-01-A:
    This task is for the Propeller Electronic Control Unit (written as the “PEC” in this procedure)fault code 268/269 − Manual Feather Input. During fault isolation if any corrective action is performed a PEC fault clear must be completed. This will make sure that the problem has been fixed and the fault code does not reappear.</p><!-- !!!! -->
