  <div>
    This fault code is generated as a result of the failure of the PEC to perform a lane change when the lane in control has a lower "health" score than the other lane. Within the PEC, there is a process to determine which lane should be in control taking into account any errors on either lane. This is an indication of an internal PEC fault.<br> The fault isolation logic has determined that a lane change should have occurred within a confirmation time of 2 seconds, but has not. The fault code is advisory but will not be annunciated to the flight crew as a PEC caution. This fault code is designated as No Despatch for TLD purposes and therefore will also illuminate the powerplant message on the engine display.
