    <p>This fault code is generated as a result of an apparent invalid FADEC torque signal from the engine FADEC to the PEC. For Post Modsum 4W113558, the fault code will only be annunciated when the propeller is rotating.</p><!-- !!!! -->

    <p>The fault isolation logic has determined that FADEC torque is invalid, as supplied by the RS422 databus from the FADEC.</p><!-- !!!! -->

    <p>The fault code is advisory but will not be annunciated to the flight crew as a PEC caution. For Pre Modsum 4W113558, this fault code is designated as no despatch for TLD purposes and therefore will also illuminate the powerplant message on the engine display. For Post Modsum 4W113558, this fault code is designated as unlimited despatch for TLD purposes, provided that repairs to correct and clear the fault are completed within 10 days of fault detection or within 150 flight hours of fault occurrence, whichever occurs later. Refer to the Continued Airworthiness Maintenance Tasks section of PMM 1096 Part 1.</p><!-- !!!! -->
