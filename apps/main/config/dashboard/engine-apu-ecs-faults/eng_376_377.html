    <p>This fault code is generated when a beta calibration has failed to complete and no other related faults (Fault codes 374 and 378) are generated. This is an internal PEC fault.</p><!-- !!!! -->

    <p>The fault isolation logic has determined that the beta calibration has not completed and that fault codes 374 and 378 have not been generated.</p><!-- !!!! -->

    <p>The fault code is advisory but will not be annunciated to the flight crew as a PEC caution. This fault code is designated as no despatch for TLD purposes and therefore will also illuminate the powerplant message on the engine display.</p><!-- !!!! -->
