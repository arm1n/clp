    </p>



    <p>This fault code is generated as a result of a failure to satisfactorily complete a test on the gain to offset EEpots within the PEC following the start of the torque trim operation. This is an internal PEC fault.</p><!-- !!!! -->

    <p>The fault isolation logic has determined that when a torque trim operation has been initiated, the answer to a series of predetermined activities within the EEpots falls outside the required limits.</p><!-- !!!! -->

    <p>This fault code will inhibit the autofeather advisory when PLA goes into the takeâˆ’off range. This fault code is designated as no despatch for TLD purposes and therefore will also illuminate the powerplant message on the engine display.</p><!-- !!!! -->

    <p>During fault isolation for OSG and AF test faults, the tests must be done again after corrective action has been taken. If the tests pass, a fault clear will be necessary to clear the fault in question.</p><!-- !!!! -->
