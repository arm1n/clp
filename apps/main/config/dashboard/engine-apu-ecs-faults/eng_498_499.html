    </p>



    <p>This fault code is generated as a result of the failure of the PEC to successfully complete an AUPC test, carried out as part of the autofeather and uptrim test. The PEC will keep this fault code until the PEC satisfactorily completes the test, even if it is removed and installed on a different powerplant.</p><!-- !!!! -->

    <p>Pre Modsum 4W113558, the fault isolation logic has determined that either the last AUPC test was aborted (AUPC TEST ABORT=1) or was not passed (AUPC TEST STATUS=0). Post Modsum 4W113558, the logic has determined that AUPC TEST ABORT = 1.</p><!-- !!!! -->

    <p>The fault code is advisory but will not be annunciated to the flight crew as a PEC caution. For Pre Modsum 4W113558, this fault code is designated as no dispatch for TLD purposes and therefore will also illuminate the powerplant message on the engine display. For Post Modsum 4W113558, this fault code is designated as unlimited dispatch for TLD purposes and will not illuminate the powerplant message on the engine display.</p><!-- !!!! -->

    <p>During fault isolation for OSG and AF test faults, the tests must be done again after corrective action has been taken. If the tests pass, a fault clear will be necessary to clear the fault in question.</p><!-- !!!! -->
