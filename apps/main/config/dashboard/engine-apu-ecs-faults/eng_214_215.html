	<p>This fault code is generated on the active lane when an OSG test has not been requested, but the PEC has determined that there is an inconsistency in the driver line voltages. This is an internal PEC fault.</p><!-- !!!! -->
	
	<p>The fault isolation logic has determined that with OSG TEST REQUEST = OFF, OS GOV RESET = 0, Lane in control, but OSG LO SIDE MON = 1.</p><!-- !!!! -->
	
	<p>The fault code is advisory but will not be annunciated to the flight crew as a PEC caution. This fault code is designated as no despatch for TLD purposes and therefore will also illuminate the powerplant message on the engine display.</p><!-- !!!! -->
	
	<p>During fault isolation for OSG and AF test faults, the tests must be done again after corrective action has been taken. If the tests pass, a fault clear will be necessary to clear the fault in question.</p><!-- !!!! -->
