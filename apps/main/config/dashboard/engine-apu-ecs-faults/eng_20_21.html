		This fault code is generated as a result of the data supplied by the FADEC to the PEC apparently not changing, i.e. no new data is being received by the PEC. For Post Modsum 4W113558, this fault will only be annunciated when the propeller is rotating. The fault isolation has determined that the RS422 received data is not changing. The fault code is advisory and will not be annunciated to the flight crew. This fault code is designated as unlimited despatch for TLD purposes.
