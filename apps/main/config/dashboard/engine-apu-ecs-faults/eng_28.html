  <div>
    This fault code is generated as a result of the control lane of the PEC indicating that no data is being received from the other lane of the PEC. This is an internal PEC fault. This fault will only be annunciated when the propeller is rotating.
  </div>
	<br>
	<div>
    The fault isolation logic has determined that for a period of 55 seconds it is not receiving data from the other lane.
  </div>
	<br>
	<div>
    The fault code is advisory and will not be annunciated to the flight crew. This fault code is designated as No Despatch for TLD purposes, and therefore will also illuminate the powerplant message on the engine display.
