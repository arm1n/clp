    <p>This fault code is generated as a result of an apparent failure of the PEC to correctly set the AUPC armed state. This is an indication of an internal PEC fault.</p><!-- !!!! -->
    <br>
    <p>The fault isolation logic has determined that either of the following has occurred:
        AUPC ARM MONITOR = not active (not armed) when the arming conditions are true, or AUPC ARM MONITOR = active (armed) when the arming conditions are false.
    </p><!-- !!!! -->
   
    <p>The fault code is advisory but will not be annunciated to the flight crew as a PEC caution. This fault code is designated as no despatch for TLD purposes and therefore will also illuminate the powerplant message on the engine display.</p><!-- !!!! -->
    
    <p>During fault isolation for OSG and AF test faults, the tests must be done again after corrective action has been taken. If the tests pass, a fault clear will be necessary to clear the fault in question.</p><!-- !!!! -->
