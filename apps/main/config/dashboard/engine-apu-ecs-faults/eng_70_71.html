	<div>This fault code is generated as a result of the failure of the propeller system to successfully complete an autofeather test, as a result of the apparent loss of the autofeather permissive signal from the opposite powerplant. The autofeather test takes place in turn on both PECs, and the fault is indicated by the PEC attempting autofeather. The isolation of this fault may necessitate the removal of both PECs for the purpose of troubleshooting, since the voltages generated to allow the test to proceed are immediately removed once the test has failed.</div><!-- !!!! -->
	<br>
	<div>The fault detection logic has determined that REMOTE AF PERMISSION = 0 at some stage during the test.</div><!-- !!!! -->
	<br>
	<div>The fault code is advisory and will not be annunciated to the flight crew. This fault code is designated as unlimited despatch for TLD purposes.</div><!-- !!!! -->
	<br>
	<div>During fault isolation for OSG and AF test faults, the tests must be done again after corrective action has been taken. If the tests pass, a fault clear will be necessary to clear the fault in question.</div><!-- !!!! -->
