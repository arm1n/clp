	<p>This fault code is generated as a result of an apparent ground beta enable voltage being detected in the PEC when the PLA is in the flight range and the PLA BETA microswitch is open. This is not an indication of a ground beta enable solenoid problem on the PCU. The fault is an internal PEC problem.</p><!-- !!!! -->
	
	<p>The fault detection logic has determined that, on the active lane, PLA BETA = 0, PLA > 40 degrees, GRD BETA ENABLE SOL = 0, and GRD BETA ENABLE SOL MON = 1.</p><!-- !!!! -->
	
	<p>The fault code is advisory but will not be annunciated to the flight crew as a PEC caution. This fault code is designated as no despatch for TLD purposes and therefore will also illuminate the powerplant message on the engine display.</p><!-- !!!! -->
	
	<p>During fault isolation for OSG and AF test faults, the tests must be done again after corrective action has been taken. If the tests pass, a fault clear will be necessary to clear the fault in question.</p><!-- !!!! -->
