	<p>This fault code is generated as a result of the apparent loss of the blade angle feedback signal from the Beta Feedback Transducer (BFT) located on the PCU, on the active PEC control lane, during beta control.</p><!-- !!!! -->
	
	<p>The fault accommodation logic has determined that no validated Beta value has been calculated for two seconds on the active lane while in beta control mode.</p><!-- !!!! -->
	
	<p>This fault code is designated as No Despatch for TLD purposes and therefore will also illuminate the POWERPLANT advisory message on the engine display. If this fault is present on both channels or if the other PEC channel has fault code 120/121, 122/123, 124/125 or 126/127, the PEC caution light will be illuminated on the CWAS</p><!-- !!!! -->
	
	<p>NOTE: If any combination of faults 120/121, 124/125, 126/127 or 130/131 are present on both PEC channels at the same time, the propeller will automatically feather on the ground if the PLA is moved below FLIGHT IDLE.</p><!-- !!!! -->
	
    
	<p>If a hard (nonâˆ’intermittent) fault of the BFT signal is present when the propeller is not rotating, the affected PEC channel will also indicate fault code 134. Code 134 provides a real time status of the BFT signal validity and will clear by itself as soon as valid blade angle is detected by the affected PEC channel</p><!-- !!!! -->
