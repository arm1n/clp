    </p>



    <p>This fault code is generated as a result of the PEC indicating that the overspeed governor test has been aborted. This can occur for any of the three reasons listed below:
        - The test has taken longer than 62 seconds
        - The right conditions were not present for the test to start
        - The right conditions were not maintained during the test.</p><!-- !!!! -->

    <p>The fault isolation logic has determined that either the duration of the test has been longer than
        62 seconds, or the following conditions have not been established or maintained:
        - Weight on wheels = on ground
        - PLA is greater than flight idle (Pre Modsum 4W113558)
        - PLA is at flight idle plus or minus 5 degrees (Post Modsum 4W113558)
        - CLA is at 1020 rpm
        - Np is greater than 600 rpm
        - Test request is selected
        - PLA Beta status is zero within 15 seconds of starting the test (Post Modsum 4W113558)</p><!-- !!!! -->

    <p>The fault code is advisory but will not be annunciated to the flight crew as a PEC caution. This fault code is designated as no dispatch for TLD purposes and therefore will also illuminate the powerplant message on the engine display (Pre Modsum 4W113558), and unlimited dispatch for Post Modsum 4W113558.</p><!-- !!!! -->

    <p>During fault isolation for OSG and AF test faults, the tests must be done again after corrective action has been taken. If the tests pass, a fault clear will be necessary to clear the fault in question (Pre Modsum 4W113558).</p><!-- !!!! -->
