    <p>This fault code is generated as a result of the failure of the PEC to generated an uptrim signal during the autofeather/uptrim test. This is an internal PEC fault.</p><!-- !!!! -->

    <p>The fault isolation logic has determined that during the autofeather test, the PEC has failed to signal UPTRIM STATE = UTQN (uptrim state machine state = uptrim both speed and torque) within a period of 5 seconds.</p><!-- !!!! -->

    <p>The fault code is advisory and will not be annunciated to the flight crew. This fault code is designated as unlimited despatch for TLD purposes.</p><!-- !!!! -->

    <p>During fault isolation for OSG and AF test faults, the tests must be done again after corrective action has been taken.If the tests pass, a fault clear will be necessary to clear the fault in question.</p><!-- !!!! -->
