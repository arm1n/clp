    </p>



    <p>This fault code is generated as a result of an apparent loss of availability of the PMA signal to the PEC.</p><!-- !!!! -->

    <p>The fault accommodation logic has determined that either the PEC PMA monitoring is not available with propeller rotation over 500 rpm, or that the discrete inputs from the FADEC to the PEC to indicate PMA availability are not available when the propeller is rotating.</p><!-- !!!! -->

    <p>The fault code is advisory but will not be annunciated to the flight crew as a PEC caution. For Pre Modsum 4W113558, this fault code is designated as no dIspatch for TLD purposes and therefore will also illuminate the powerplant message on the engine display. For Post Modsum 4W113558, this fault code is designated as unlimited dIspatch for TLD purposes, provided that repairs to correct and clear the fault are completed within 10 days of fault detection or within 150 flight hours of fault occurrence, whichever occurs later. Refer to the Continued Airworthiness Maintenance Tasks section of PMM 1096 Part 1.</p><!-- !!!! -->
