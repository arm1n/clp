        <clp-link-tr>(TR-FIM)</clp-link-tr>
    </p>



    <p>This fault code is generated as a result of a mismatch between the UPTRIM command and the electrical state of the UPTRIM discrete from Channel A of the local PEC to the opposite side FADEC.</p><!-- !!!! -->

    <p>The fault isolation logic has determined that, for a period of 1 second either:
        – an uptrim signal has been sent by PEC Channel A to the opposite powerplant when not required, or
        – an uptrim signal has not been sent by PEC Channel A to the opposite powerplant when required.</p><!-- !!!! -->

    <p>This fault code will inhibit the A/F ARM advisory message on Engine Display when PLA goes into the take−off range, which will result in an aborted take−off. There is no impact on TLD. This fault when present will cause the flight crew initiated autofeather test to fail.</p><!-- !!!! -->

    <p>This fault can be triggered if the discrete wire between the PEC Channel A and the opposite side FADEC is shorted to ground or shield. The opposite side FADEC may also show fault 771.</p><!-- !!!! -->
