	<p>Post SB84-61-01-A:
	This task is for the Propeller Electronic Control Unit (written as the "PEC" in this procedure) fault code 272/273 âˆ’ Feather Monitor. During fault isolation if any corrective action is performed a PEC fault clear must be completed. This will make sure that the problem has been fixed and the fault code does not reappear.</p><!-- !!!! -->
	
	<p>Pre SB84-61-01-A:
	This fault code is generated as a result of an apparent mismatch between the pilot autofeather switch state and the monitor within the PEC. This is an internal PEC fault.</p><!-- !!!! -->
    <p>The fault isolation logic has determined that AFSELECT = OFF (no requirement for autofeather arm selected) and AF FET MON = ON (autofeather arm selected).</p><!-- !!!! -->
    <p>The fault code is advisory but will not be annunciated to the flight crew as a PEC caution. This fault code is designated as no despatch for TLD purposes and therefore will also illuminate the powerplant message on the engine display.</p><!-- !!!! -->
