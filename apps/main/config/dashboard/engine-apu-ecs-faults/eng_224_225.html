	<p>This fault code is generated as a result of a discrepancy between the voltages being recorded on either side of the Ground Beta Enable switch internal to the PEC. This is not an indication of a Ground Beta Enable Solenoid problem on the PCU. The fault is an internal PEC problem.</p><!-- !!!! -->
	
	<p>The fault detection logic has determined that, on the active lane, PLA BETA = 1, GROUND BETA ENABLE SOL MON = 1 and GROUND BETA ENABLE SOL = Switch Closed (demanded closed) for a confirmation time of 2.5 seconds.</p><!-- !!!! -->
	
	<p>This fault code will be annunciated as a PEC caution on the ACWS. This fault code is designated as No Despatch for TLD purposes and therefore will also illuminate the powerplant message on the engine display.</p><!-- !!!! -->
