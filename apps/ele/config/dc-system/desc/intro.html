<p>The Electrical Power Generation and Distribution system (EPGDS) supplies electrical energy to all electrical equipment through an AC Variable Frequency System and Main 28 Vdc Generation System. The EPGDS does energy conversion, distribution, storage, control, protection, monitoring, and indication.</p>

<p>The main 28 Vdc generation system has two dc starter/generators, one on each engine, and two Transformer Rectifier Units (TRUs) to supply electrical power independently to the left and right DC bus systems. A DC external power receptacle and control circuitry allowsthe system to be powered from an external power source while the aircraft is on the ground.</p>
