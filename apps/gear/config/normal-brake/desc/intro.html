<p>The brake system for the Main Landing Gear (MLG) lets the aircraft brake normally to decrease its speed during ground operations. When a pilotâ€™s brake pedal is pushed, the attached tie rod moves a pushrod to operate the brake control lever. Movement of the brake control lever extends the lever spring and pulls the control cable to operate the applicable lever on the brake control valve. Hydraulicpressure from the No. 1 system is supplied to the skid control valve when the brake control valve lever is operated. </p>

<p>The brake control valve will supply hydraulic pressure in proportion to the amount of brake pedal travel. Hydraulic pressure is supplied from the skid control valve through the fuse/shuttle valves to the applicable MLG brake units.</p>

<p>When the brake pedal is released, the lever spring returns the brake pedal to the off position. A spring in the brake control valve returns the valve to the off position. The brake pressure
	is released to return and the valve inlet port is closed.</p>

<p>When the MLG brake unit is actuated, pressurized hydraulic fluid from the MLG brake system moves the pistons to push the pressure plate assembly. The pressure plate assembly pushes the rotor
	disks, the stator disks, and the end plate together. As the stator disks and the rotor disks are pushed against each other, the friction between the disks causes resistance. The resistance is
	transmitted from the MLG brake unit to the wheel and tire assemblies causing the wheel to slow down.</p>
