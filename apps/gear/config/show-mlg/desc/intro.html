<p><strong>MAIN LANDING GEAR - General Description</strong></p>

<p>The Main Landing Gear (MLG) absorbs and distributes the loads of landing. The MLG also supports the aircraft on the ground. Each MLG assembly is installed on the airframe structure in the wheelwell of the related engine nacelle. Each MLG has two wheel and tire assemblies and retracts rearwards into the aft section of the wheelwell.</p>

<p>A retraction actuator is attached to the yoke and to the shock strut to extend and retract the MLG. A lock actuator on the stabilizer brace locks the MLG in the down position. An auxiliary extension actuator is attached to the airframe structure in the aft section of the wheelwell and to the arm of the yoke. The auxiliary extension actuator extends the MLG during an alternate extension sequence. An uplock assembly is attached to the top of the aft section of the wheelwell and locks the MLG in the retracted position.<br>
A proximity sensor on the uplock assembly gives a signal to the Proximity Sensor Electronic Unit (PSEU) of the status of the MLG. Proximity sensors on the stabilizer brace send signals to the 
PSEU when the MLG is down and locked. Proximity sensors on the torque links give an indication to the PSEU of a Weight−On−wheels or a Weight−Off−Wheels condition.</p>
