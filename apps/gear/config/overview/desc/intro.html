<p>The landing gear supports the weight of the aircraft on the ground. It is also used to maneuver the aircraft on the ground. The landing gear is electrically controlled, hydraulically operated and mechanically locked. The hydraulically operated nosewheel steering gives directional control during taxiing, take−off and landing. Each main wheel has hydraulically powered anti−skid brakes. There is also an emergency/park brake system.</p>

<p>The tricycle gear is a retractable dual wheel installation. The main gears retract aft into the nacelles and the nose gear retracts forward into the nose section. Gear doors completely enclose 
the landing gear when it is retracted and partially enclose the gear when it is extended. Flight compartment advisory lights show position of gear doors and downlocks. 
An aural warning sounds if the gear is not extended and the aircraft is in a landing configuration.
A Proximity Switch Electronics Unit (PSEU) monitors and controls the operation of the landing gear components.</p>

<p>An alternate landing gear extension method can be used to extend the gear if the primary extension method fails. There is also an alternate downlock verification system.
The nosewheel is steerable by a flight compartment hand control or by the rudder pedals. The main wheels are equipped with anti skid multiple disc brakes. The brakes can be controlled by 
the brake pedals or the EMERG BRAKE lever.</p>
