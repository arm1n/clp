<p><strong>POSITION & WARNING</strong></p>

<p>The landing gear position lights show the position of each landing gear and the related doors.</p>

<p>The landing gear position lights are operated by the uplock and the downlock sensors through the Proximity Switch Electronics Unit (PSEU).</p>
<ul>
	<li>The landing gears are down and locked</li>
	<li>The landing gears are not locked up or down</li>
	<li>The landing gear doors stayed open after landing gear extension or retraction</li>
	<li>WThe landing gears are not in the up and locked position or the down and locked position</li>
</ul>

<p>An alternative indication of landing gear extension is given by the visual indicators. The visual indicators are installed in the flight compartment behind the LANDING GEAR ALTERNATE EXTENSION door.</p>

<p>A landing gear configuration warning is sounded in the flight compartment by the Remote Control Audio Unit (RCAU). The landing gear configuration warning will sound if all the landing gears are not in a safe condition for the landing. A HORN MUTE and TEST switch is installed on the landing gear selector panel.</p>

<p>The Proximity Sensor System (PSS) is a part of the landing gear system. The system gives:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Landing Gear Control (LGC)</li>
	<li>Landing Gear status Indication (LGI)</li>
	<li>Alternate Downlock Indication (ADI)</li>
	<li>Weight−On−Wheels indication (WOW1 and WOW2)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Proximity Sensor System (PSS) has a Proximity Sensor Electronics Unit (PSEU) and proximity sensors.</p>

<p>The PSS uses 20 proximity sensors to give the position of the landing gear and the gear doors.</p>

<p>The outputs of the sensors are processed by the PSEU. They also show the position of the landing gear components, aircraft on ground and gear doors.</p>
