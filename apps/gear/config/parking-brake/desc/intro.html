<p><strong>PARKING BRAKE SYSTEM - General Description</strong></p>

<p>The parking brake system uses hydraulic pressure from the No. 2 hydraulic system. An accumulator in the brake system supplies pressure for parking brake operation when the engines are stopped. A handpump can be used to manually pressurize the accumulator when the aircraft is on the ground.</p>

<p>Parking brake pressure is applied equally to all of the main wheel brake 
unit A PARKING BRAKE caution light on the Caution and Warning panel in the flight compartment comes on when the parking brake lever is in the PARK position. A pressure indicator is 
installed in the flight compartment to indicate the parking brake pressure available.</p>
