<p><strong>PRIMARY EXTENSION AND RETRACTION General Description</strong></p>

<p>The Primary Extension and Retraction system controls the extension and retraction of the landing gear and the landing gear doors operation. Hydraulic retraction and extension starts when the LANDING GEAR selector lever is moved to the desired position. The PSEU checks the status of the landing gear and the landing gear doors, and compares it to the command selected. The PSEU controls the hydraulic sequences to either fully extend or fully retract the landing gear. </p>

<p>The status of the landing gear and the landing gear doors is shown by the indicator lights on the LANDING GEAR control panel. A LDG GEAR INOP caution light on the Caution and Warning panel shows a fault in the landing gear retraction and extension system.</p>
