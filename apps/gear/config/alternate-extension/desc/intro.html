<p><strong>ALTERNATE EXTENSION SYSTEM General Description</strong></p>

<p>The alternate extension system can be used to extend the landing gear when the No. 2 hydraulic system, or the Proximity Sensor Unit (PSEU) are not serviceable. The system can also be used, 
if the normal extension system fails to lock the landing gear in the down position.</p>

<p>The alternate extension system is a self resetting, cable actuated design. Access to the alternate extension system is through the flight compartment. The alternate extension system includes a bypass valve to isolate the landing gear hydraulics from the No. 2 hydraulic system. A manual handpump hydraulic system is available to assist in lowering the Main Landing Gear (MLG) into the 
down and locked position.</p>

<p>The alternate extension of the landing gear occurs when the Nose Landing Gear (NLG) forward doors, the MLG aft doors, and the landing gear uplocks are mechanically opened. <br>
The NLG free−falls to the down and locked position, assisted by the airflow. The MLGs free−fall and, if required, are pumped to the down and locked position by the alternate extension actuators.
To isolate the normal landing gear selector valve during flight, a LANDING GEAR INHIBIT switch is installed in the flight compartment ceiling. To use the alternate extension system, 
the LANDING GEAR INHIBIT switch must be set from NORMAL to INHIBIT.</p>
