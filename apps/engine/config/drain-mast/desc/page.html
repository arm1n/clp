<p><b>ENGINE NACELLE DRAIN LINES</b></p>
<p>To prevent the accumulation of flammable fluids or water in the nacelle, overboard drains are provided for all the nacelle zones. Engine drain lines are connected to the lower cowl drain system and routed overboard through the external drain mast.</p>

<p>The engine drains are divided into a forward drain system and a rear drain system. The forward and the rear drains connect to the lower cowl drain lines and are routedseparately to an external drain mast.</p>

<p>The forward drain lines are routed individually to a collector tank except for the auxiliary feathering pump seal and the engine driven hydraulic pump seal. These two drain lines are joined upstream of the collector tank. The collector tank connects to a drain line in the lower cowl through a flexible hose with two Camloc fasteners. This attachment allows for a quick release during removal or lowering of the lower cowl to the maintenance position.</p>

<p>The rear drain lines are routed to a manifold which is also connected to the lower cowl through a flexible hose with two Camloc fasteners. From these connections, the forward and the rear drains are routed separately to the aft end of the lower cowl and then overboard through the external drain mast.</p>

<p>The oil filler drain is not routed with the engine drains. Excess oil is discharged directly into the port side forward sump of Zone 1. Excess oil is drained from the oil filler cap area into the Zone 1 sump and is then routed overboard through the lower cowl drains.</p>
