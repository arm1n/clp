<p><strong>PSEU Present Fault Menu Item</strong></p>

<p>The “Present Faults” sub−menu shows faults which are currently present on the aircraft. These are hard faults that the PSEU sees at that time. The BITE system will show the full list of reported faults.</p>

<clp-text-blue><strong>NOTE:</strong> There is no flight leg or indication of an intermittent fault shown for “Present Faults”.</clp-text-blue>

<br>
<p>If a shown fault clears and there is no keypad button activity, the display will be updated with the message “Fault No Longer Present” within 10 seconds. If “Fault No Longer Present” shows and the fault returns while there is no keypad button activity, the fault message will reappear on the display.</p>
