<p><strong>Rigging History Menu Item</strong></p>

<p>The “Rigging History” sub−menu gives a summary of all the logged instances of pending failure conditions for each proximity sensor. These failure conditions show that one sensor installation will change. This could be because of wear or because of damage. For example, the installation has a Valid Near condition, but the target is too near to the sensor’s face. A Rigging History fault is recorded to tell the mechanic to examine the installation of that sensor.</p>

<p>Only sensors which have one or more instances of a Rigging Fault kept in NVRAM are shown in the “Rigging History” list.</p>
