<clp-info-blue><b>Identification Method</b></clp-info-blue>
<p></p>
<p>Each access panel, door, or fairing has a two−group identification code that indicates its
position on the aircraft.</p>



<div><b>1. A Three−digit Numeric Group</b></div>
<p>This three−digit numeric group identifies the Major zone/Major sub−zone/unit zone where the
	access panels, doors, or fairings are located.</p>

<ul>
				<li>Zoning data is supplied to make the location of work areas and components easier. The aircraft is divided into eight major zones numbered from 100 to 800, in increments of 100. Each major zone is subdivided into major sub-zones and unit zones.</li>
				<li>Major sub−zones are subdivisions of the major zones. Each major sub−zone is identified by the second digit of the three digit number.</li>
				<li>Unit zones are subdivisions of the major sub−zones. Each unit zone is identified by the third digit of the three digit number.</li>
			</ul>

<br>
<div><b>2. A Two−digit Letter Group</b></div>
<div>This two−digit letter group gives the position of the access panel, door, or fairing in relation to the aircraft as follows:</div><br>
<clp-text-blue><strong>NOTE:</strong> The letters “I” and “O” are not used.</clp-text-blue>

<clp-table border nowrap="1">
	<clp-tr>
		<clp-td><strong>FIRST LETTER</strong></clp-td>
		<clp-td>The <b>first letter</b> identifies the general position of the access door, panel or fairing on theaircraft. This starts with the letter “A” and goes from inboard to outboard and from front to rear.</clp-td>
	</clp-tr>

	<clp-tr>
		<clp-td><strong>SECOND LETTER</strong></clp-td>
		<clp-td>The <b>second letter</b> identifies the location of the access door, panel or fairing in relation to the aircraft as follows:
			<ul>
				<li>T = Top</li>
				<li>B = Bottom</li>
				<li>L = Left Side</li>
				<li>R = Right Side</li>
