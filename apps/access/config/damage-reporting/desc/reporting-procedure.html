				<p>The checklist is exactly that … a check list to go over to be sure that all relevant information is given either on the checklist form or in the attached damage report that follows. Basic aircraft and contact information is the same for each form. Damage description requirements reflect what is required for each type of structure.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>It is recommended that the checklist be photocopied and used directly, or used as a reference to construct an in house version. The damage reporting checklist has been developed to aid in reporting damage.</li>
					<br>
					<li>The checklist is applicable to both metallic and composite structures. When preparing a damage report, the checklist can be used as reference, or photocopied and used directly. Its use should ensure sufficient data is being provided to Bombardier Aerospace Structures Repair Engineers.</li>
					<br>
					<li>The checklist should be <b>completed in as much detail as possible,</b> and submitted along with a sketch, drawing, and/or modified digital photo of the damaged area. (See <clp-link-pdf>SRM TASK 51-15-05-00-01</clp-link-pdf> <clp-link-tr>(TR-SRM)</clp-link-tr>)</li>
