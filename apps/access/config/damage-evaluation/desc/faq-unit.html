					<p>Check in the applicable chapter of Generic Structural Repair Schemes - repair index for an appropriate RD.</p>

					<p>A good example according - <clp-link-pdf>SRM TASK 53-10-31-01-01</clp-link-pdf> providing allowable damage limits for the nose fuselage skin. Details are given for the type of damage and the maximum allowable damage to a specified location. In this example the allowable damages are for the permanent continued operation of the aircraft and the temporary continued operation of the aircraft for 800 flight hours maximum.</p>

				<clp-expandable name="D. Is damage repairable according Structural Repair Manual (SRM) or (RD’s)?">

					<p>Check if generic permanent repairs acc. SRM chapters 52 to 57 apply. Check in the applicable chapter of Generic Structural Repair Schemes - repair index for an appropriate RD. </p>

					<p>There are several RD’s available in chapter 53 providing blendout limits for seat rails. If alternate fasteners are required, check Generic Structural Repair Schemes chapter 51. Several RD’s providing alternate rivets etc. are listed there.</p>

				</clp-expandable>

				<clp-expandable name="E. Is damage repairable by parts replacement?">

					<p>Sometimes it is easier and more economical to replace damaged structural parts (like small stiffeners, wing tips, trailing edges etc.) than to repair them, especially when there is no generic repair available.</p>

					<p>This is because costs at DeHavilland for a specific repair drawing are high. Information on how specific parts shall be installed (like fasteners used, raw material for new manufactured parts, protective treatment) is available from the DeHavilland Drawings in the FSR’s office (they can be obtained via TE).</p>

					<p>A good example for repair by parts replacement is a cracked stiffener, whereby a new stiffener is locally manufactured from the raw material listed on the DeHavilland drawing, and installed using fasteners specified in the applicable DeHavilland assembly drawing. This brings the aircraft back to “original build standard”.</p>
