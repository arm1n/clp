<p>The No. 3 hydraulic system is installed in the aft fuselage. The system operates automatically 
during an emergency condition when the No. 1 and/or No. 2 hydraulic systems are unavailable, 
or when both engines indicate low oil pressure. The No. 3 hydraulic system can also be 
engaged manually when the HYD #3 ISOL VLV switch, located on the HYDRAULIC CONTROL 
Panel in the flight compartment, is set to OPEN. The No. 3 hydraulic system uses an 
accumulator which is pressurized by a DC Motor Driven Pump (DCMP).</p>

<p>During normal flight operation, the system is in an active standby mode with the 
accumulator isolation valve closed. The DCMP operates intermittently to keep 
the system pressurized to within the range of 2600 to 3250 psi (17926 to 22407 kPa). 
In the event of a dual engine failure, when both Engine Driven Pumps (EDPs) and the 
Standby Power Unit (SPU) are unavailable, or when either system 1 or 2 pressure 
switches indicate low pressure, the No.3 hydraulic system will power the elevators.</p>



<div>
	<clp-text-blue><strong>NOTE:</strong> If the elevators are operated with the isolation valve closed, system pressure will drop to less than 200 psi (1379 kPa). Over time, the residual pressure may rise, up to a maximum 1000 psi (6895 kPa).</clp-text-blue>
