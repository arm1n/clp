<div>The alternate extension system gives a means of extending the landing gear when:</div>
<ul>
	<li>The LDG GEAR INOP caution light is on </li>
	<li>The Landing gear indication fails </li>
	<li>There is a Loss of No. 2 hydraulic system pressure </li>
</ul>

<p>The landing gear extension INHIBIT switch is installed in the flight compartment ceiling, adjacent to 
the main LANDING GEAR ALTERNATE RELEASE door. It removes electrical power from the landing 
gear selector.</p>

<p>When the main LANDING GEAR ALTERNATE RELEASE door on the flight compartment ceiling is opened 
it mechanically opens a bypass valve in the normal hydraulic extension system, and gives access to the 
MAIN L/G RELEASE handle. Pulling the handle releases the main landing gear doors and uplocks. 
The main gear will free fall but may not fully extend. </p>

<p>The LANDING GEAR ALTERNATE EXTENSION door, on the flight compartment floor, must then be fully 
opened giving access to the alternate extension handpump and the NOSE L/G RELEASE handle. 
Opening the door mechanically operates the NLG alternate selector valve. If the MLG does not  reach 
the down and locked position, the extension pump handle, located behind the copilot, is inserted into 
the pump handle socket and operated to complete main gear extension and subsequent downlock. 
Both the LANDING GEAR ALTERNATE EXTENSION door and the MAIN LANDING GEAR ALTERNATE 
RELEASE door must be left fully open after alternate landing gear extension. </p>

<p>When the NOSE L/G RELEASE handle is pulled, the nose gear uplock and doors are released and the 
nose gear free falls to a down and locked position, assisted by the airflow.</p>
