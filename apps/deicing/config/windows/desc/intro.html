<p><strong>WINDSHIELDAND WINDOWS ICE AND RAIN PROTECTION</strong></p>

<p>The windshield anti−icing system prevents ice formation on both windshields and the pilot’s side window. The windows are electrothermally anti-iced. </p>

<p>The windshield anti−icing system is controlled by an overhead switch labelled HEAT located on the WINDSHIELD wiper control panel. The pilot’s side window anti-icing is controlled using a two position toggle switch labelled PLT SIDE WDO/HT also located on the WINDSHIELD wiper control panel.</p>

<p>The windshield and pilot’s side window heaters are controlled by the Anti-Ice Controller (AIC). If either AIC fails, the <clp-text-orange><b>WSHLD CTRL</b></clp-text-orange> caution light will come on.<br> If the HEAT selector is in the OFF position the <clp-text-orange><b>WSHLD CTRL</b></clp-text-orange> caution light is prevented from coming on. The windshield and pilot’s side window heaters are controlled by the Anti−Ice Controller (AIC). If either AIC fails, the <clp-text-orange><b>WSHLD CTRL</b></clp-text-orange> caution light will come on. If the HEAT selector is in the OFF position the <clp-text-orange><b>WSHLD CTRL</b></clp-text-orange> caution light is prevented from coming on.</p>

<p>The AIC sends signals to operate the related windshield heater relay. The 115 Vac C phase left bus supplies power for the pilot’s windshield in the NORM mode. It also supplies power to both windshields in the WARM UP mode. The 115 Vac C phase right bus supplies power for the copilot’s windshield in the NORM mode.<br>The 115 Vac A phase right bus supplies power for the pilot’s side window.</p>
