<p><strong>ICE AND RAIN PROTECTION, GENERAL</strong></p>

<p>The Ice and Rain Protection System (IRPS) includes ice detection, de-icing, anti−icing and rain removal.</p>


<p>The Ice Detection System (IDS) assists in determining ice build−up and sends this information to the pilots in the flight compartment so that they can take the appropriate action.</p>

<p>The Pneumatic De-ice System removes ice which has accumulated on the leading edges of the wings, horizontal and vertical stabilizers, and the inlet lip of the engine nacelles. The leading edges of the propeller blades are electrically de-iced.</p>

<p>The Anti−icing Systems are thermal, using electrical heating elements to prevent ice formation.</p>

<p>Conventional electrically operated windshield wipers provide rain removal of the pilot and copilot’s windshields. </p>

<div>The Ice and Rain Protection System (IRPS) has the sub−systems that follow:</div>
<ul>
	<li>Airframe De−icing Systems</li>
	<li>Air Intake De−icing </li>
	<li>Pitot and Static Anti−Icing System</li>

</ul>
