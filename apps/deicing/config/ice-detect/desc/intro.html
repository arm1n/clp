<p><strong>ICE DETECTION SYSTEM</strong></p>

<p>The Ice Detection System (IDS) gives early detection and indication of aircraft icing conditions. This system is not activated or controlled by the flight crew, it is operative during all of the flight.</p>

<p>The IDS has two electronic ice, detector probes on the front fuselage and spigots installed 
in the pilots field of vision on the windshield wiper arms. It advises the crew of icing conditions when ice accumulation on the IDP is greater than 0.02 in. (0.5 mm).</p>

<p>The IDS is activated when 115 Vac electrical power is available. When ice accumulation is sensed the words <b>ICE DETECTED</b> appear on the Engine Display (ED). The Integrated Flight Cabinets (IFC) interface with the Electronic Instrument System (EIS) to generate the ICE DETECTED advisory message.The ice sensor operates on a piezoelectric principle based on two IDP. It continuously vibrates at its natural resonant frequency and when ice accumulates on the ice sensor, the frequency of vibration increases due to an increase in rigidity. Water or liquid contaminants increase the diaphragm mass without increasing its stiffness, causing the natural frequency to drop.<br> 
The frequency change is electronically converted to supply the elec- trical signal that shows ICE DETECTED on the Engine Systems Inte- grated Display (ESID), Engine Display (ED) page. It also triggers the heater circuit of the IDP to deice the sensor. </p>

<p>Only one advisory message is shown when ice is sensed by one or both Ice Detector Probes (IDP). The message will also flash until the propeller deice control switch is selected to ON. The ICE 
DETECTED message is out of view when no ice is detected.The ICE DETECTED message will 
remain in view for a minimum of 60 Â±5 seconds.</p>
