<p><strong>PROPELLERS ANTI−ICING</strong></p>

<p>Ice detection is not available for the propeller antiicing system, therefore to avoid excessive build−up of ice, the pilot must select propeller heat ON when flying through known icing conditions. </p>

<p>When heat is selected ON, all six blades on one propeller are heated at one time, then the propeller on the other side is heated.</p>

<p>The TMCU performs continuous passive fault monitoring of the propeller deice system. An active pilot-initiated test mode is available to support preflight functional test. Nominal blade heater 
resistance is measured during a manually initiated calibration sequence and recorded in Non-Volatile Memory (NVM).</p>

<p>The calibration data is used during the passive fault monitoring and pre-flight functional test to monitor the blade heater elements. A fault indicator output discrete signal indicates 
when a system fault is sensed by the TMCU. <br>The isolation contactor drive signal is disabled by the TMCU when a fault (which limits continued safe operation of the system) is sensed. All detected faults are recorded in NVM.<br>
The propeller deicing system monitors the propeller speed (Np) and Total Air Temperature (TAT).</p>
