<p>Three pitot−static probes incorporate electrical heating elements to prevent icing which can cause incorrect pitot or static measurements. The Dash 8 Series 400 does not have dedicated pitot probes and static ports but uses three integrated pitot and static probes. The No. 1 probe is located below the pilot’s windshield, the No. 2 probe is located below the copilot’s windshield, and the No. 3 (standby) probe is located below the bottom aft corner of the copilot’s side window.</p>

<p>The heaters of the Pitot-Static probes and the angle of attack transducer are monitored by the TMU. This function is performed by the three independent modules of the TMU for each of the left, right and standby Pitot-Static probes, and two different modules for the left and right angle of attack vanes.</p>

<p>These monitoring modules have an independent power supply. The probe and AOA transducer heaters are automatically on as soon as their power supply is available.The heater power is supplied through the TMU. Power sources to the left and right Pitot-Static probes are connected directly through the control switches. </p>

<p>The standby probe is connected through a relay, activated closed by the selection of the related control switch. The angle of attack vanes heaters are directly connected to their power supply through the TMU. The TMU checks for failure by monitoring current through the heaters. </p>

<p>Heating of the Pitot-Static probes is controlled by three separate switches, one for each probe. These switches are located on the IRPS panel on the left overhead console.
