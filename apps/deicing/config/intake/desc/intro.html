<p><strong>ENGINE AIR INTAKE ANTIâˆ’ICING</strong></p>

<p>The 
engine adapter heater has two 1000 W heating elements (one main and one 
spare). Engine air intake deicing prevents ice build-up on the engines. The engine air intake is integrally anti-iced by reduction gear box scavenge oil heat.</p>

<p>Each heated adapter is controlled by the ENGINE INTAKE switchlights on the ICE PROTECTION panel. When an ENGINE INTAKE switchlight is pushed, the bypass door of that engine starts to open to evacuate ice pieces shed from nacelle inlet components. The OPEN or CLOSED lights show the 
position of the related bypass doors.When the heaters are powered, the HTR lights in the ENGINE INTAKE switchlights (on the ICE PROTECTION control panel) come on.</p>

<div><b>Power is supplied to the heater through a relay when all of these 
conditions are correct:</b></div>
<ul>
	<li>Temperature measured by a thermostat in the fuselage is below +60 F (+15.6 C)</li>
	<li>Related engine oil pressure switch is closed </li>
	<li>ENGINE INTAKE switchlight has been pushed</li>
	<li>115 Vac power is available</li>
</ul>
