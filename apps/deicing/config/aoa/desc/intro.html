<p><strong>Stall Warning/Stick Pusher Introduction</strong></p>

<p>The Stall Warning / Stick Pusher system supplies the flight crew with warnings of an impending stall during flight. The system pushes the control columns forward to assist in stall recovery.</p>

<p>Warnings of an impending stall are supplied by column stick shakers, and an audio warning. The system has two identical independent channels, two separate Angle of Attack (AOA) vanes, and inputs from various parameters.<br> If both stall protection systems reach the stick pusher reference, stick pusher assistance will be provided to reduce the angle of attack.</p>

<p>The left and right independent stall warning systems supply a warning of an impending stall by activating both stick shakers on the control columns. If either the left or right system senses an impending stall, both stick shakers activate.</p>

<p>An
electrically operated stick pusher system activated by the Stall Protection Module supplies forward pitch to prevent a deep stall. The electric actuator pushes both control columns forward if an uncorrected stall is sensed by both left and right systems.</p>

<p> If the stall continues, the stick pusher applies a pitch force to push the control columns forward and decrease the angle of attack to prevent further penetration of the stall threshold</p>
