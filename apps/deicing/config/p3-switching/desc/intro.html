<p><strong>P3 SWITCHING</strong></p>

<p>With the Bleed Switch in the <b>'OFF'</b> position, HPSOV control is given to the <clp-text-blue><b>BLEED STAGE PRESSURE SWITCH</b></clp-text-blue>. This will prevent overpressurizing the engine bleed system.</p>

<p>With the Bleed Switch in the <b></b>'ON' position, HPSOV control is given to the <clp-text-blue><b>ECSECU</b></clp-text-blue>. <br>The ECS ECU will change the operating point of the HPSOV. Based on the P3 pressure from a engine mounted <b>P3 SENSOR</b>, via FADEC and the input output processors, the ECSECU will be operating the HPSOV on the basic schedule.</p>

<p>With aircraft in a decent mode of greater than 450 ft/min the ECSECU will set a higher operating point for the HPSOV to maintain maximum air available to the environmental system. When the wing De-Icing system has been activated, the control of the HPSOV is given to the Bleed Stage Pressure Switch. This will insure that sufficient bleed pressure is available to the de-icing system at all altitudes and engine power settings.</p>

<p>The ECU uses (P3.0) information supplied by FADEC to control the opening and closing of the HPSOV when De-Ice is selected off and engine bleed is selected on.</p>

<p>When the bleed air switches on the air conditioning panel are selected OFF, (or De-Ice is selected ON), the control is removed from the ECU and the bleed stage pressure switch will open or close the HPSOV.</p>
