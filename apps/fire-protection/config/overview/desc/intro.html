<p><strong>FIRE PROTECTION SYSTEM GENERAL DESCRIPTION</strong></p>

<p>The fire protection system includes components throughout the aircraft to provide detection, extinguishing and indication of fire conditions.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Fire Detection System</b></p>

<p>The fire detection system is designed to sense fire, overheat and smoke conditions. Fire or overheat detection is done by six Advanced Pneumatic Detectors (APD) in the nacelles and one APD in the APU.</p>

<p>Smoke detection is done by two smoke detectors located in the aft baggage compartment, one in the forward baggage compartment and one in the lavatory.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Fire Extinguishing System</b></p>

<p>The fire extinguishing system provides components throughout the aircraft for the extinguishing of detected fires.</p>

<p>Two dual−port fire−extinguishing bottles are installed in the left wing root for engine nacelle fire or overheat suppression. Both bottles can be used to extinguish a fire in either engine.</p>

<p>Fire extinguishing for the baggage compartments is performed by two High Rate Discharge (HRD) fire extinguisher bottles and one Low Rate Discharge (LRD) fire extinguisher bottle. Each baggage compartment has one HRD fire extinguisher bottle; the LRD bottle is shared between the FWD and AFT baggage compartments.</p>

<p>One fire−extinguishing bottle is used to suppress fire and overheat conditions in the APU compartment.</p>

<p>The lavatory waste bin is protected by a single thermally−activated fire−extinguisher.</p>
