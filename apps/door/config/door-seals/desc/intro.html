<p>The door seal pressurization system seals the forward passenger and aft baggage doors to prevent loss of cabin pressure.</p>

<p>The door seal pressurization system uses airframe deicing air to inflate seals on the forward passenger door and the aft baggage door. The seals inflate when the door is closed and the door handle is in the closed position. </p>

<p>The seals deflate when the door handle is turned to the open position. If the aircraft engines are not operating, the air is supplied from a pressurized reservoir tank. When the aircraft is on the ground, the tank is pressurized through a charging valve located in the wardrobe.</p>
