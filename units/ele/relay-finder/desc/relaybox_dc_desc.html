<h2>DC Contactor Box</h2>

<p>The DC Contactor Box (DCCB) assembly is used to distribute and control the main 28 Vdc electrical power. The DCCB contains monitor and protection components in a protected environment. The box has covers to allow access to the internal line 
replaceable units (LRUs)</p>

<p>The electrical power connections between contactors in the DCCB is made with bus bars. They are attached by a mounting plate assembly that secures the bus bars in the DCCB. Standard cable is used to make the connections between the mounting plate assembly and the box connectors. The DCCB has circuit breakers to protect the feeder cables that are routed directly to the aircraft equipment or to the circuit breaker panels in the flight compartment. The DCCB cover must be removed to get access to the circuit breakers.</p>

<p>The components in the DCCB give control and distribution of the DC power source from the two DC starter/generators transformer rectifier units, main and auxiliary batteries, or DC external power source.</p>
