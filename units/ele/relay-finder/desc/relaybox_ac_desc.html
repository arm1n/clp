<h2>AC CONTACTOR BOXES</h2>

<p>The Left AC Contactor Box (LACCB) and Right AC Contactor Box (RACCB) are assemblies that are used to distribute and control the threeâˆ’phase ac power. The ACCBs contain monitor and protection components in a protected environment. The box cover allows access to the internal Line Replaceable Units (LRUs). </p>

<p>The electrical power connections between contactors in the ACCBs are made with bus bars. They are attached by a mounting plate assemby that secures the bus bars in the ACCBs. Standard cable is used to make the connections between the mounting plate assembly and the box connectors. The LACCB and RACCB have circuit breakers to protect the feeder cables that are routed directly to the aircraft equipment or to the ac variable frequency circuit breaker</p>

<p>When the galleys are installed, the LACCB and RACCB have galley contactors to energize the galley buses.The components in the LACCB and RACCB gives control and distribution of the ac power source from the two ac generators or ac external power source.</p>
