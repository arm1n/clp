<p><strong>DIGITAL DISPLAY OF BATTERY LOAD (white)</strong></p><ul>
	<li>displays the load of the battery</li>
	<li>+ or - sign on the left of the lead digit, whether the battery is in overcharge ("+" displayed) or in discharge ("-" displayed)</li>
	<li>MAIN, AUX, STBY (white)</li>
	<li>nothing is displayed when the battery is in charge within the expected range</li>
	<li>leading zero is suppressed in the lead digit position</li>
	<li>digital number gives the rate of the load, with 1.00 equal to 100% of load</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>"+1.30" indicates that the battery is in overcharge at 30% over the maximum rate of the charge</li>
	<li>".60" indicates that the battery is in charge at 60% of its maximum rate of charge</li>
	<li>"-0.30 " indicates that the battery is discharging at 30% over the maximum rate of discharge</li>
</ul>
