<p><strong>DC CONTACTOR K21</strong></p>

<p>K21 is activated closed when the DC bus tie toggle switch input to the EPCU is energized. This function is locked out by the EPCU when a bus fault is sensed. A reset is done by supplying a reset signal to the SPCU. </p>


<div><b>K21</b> is also controlled automatically by the <b>EPCU</b> to tie the main feeder buses if:</div>
<ul>
	<li>No overcurrent is sensed by the DC GCUs, and</li>
	<li>Bus tie toggle switch is set, or</li>
	<li>One DC starter/generator is defective, or</li>
	<li>DC external power is supplied, or</li>
	<li>APU power is supplied</li>
	
</ul>
