<p>On aircraft with ModSum 4Q126354 or SB84−29−19 incorporated, in the event of the No. 2 engine failure in flight, the PTU comes on. In case of the subsequent depletion of fluid quantity in the No. 2 main hydraulic system, or when the hydraulic system No. 1 pressure decreases, the PTU will automatically shut down. This will prevent the PTU runaway and the confusing sequence of pressure fluctuations. It will also prevent hydraulic system No. 1 caution light from coming on before the hydraulic system No. 1 priority valve can close.</p>
