<p><strong>LEFT GALLEY LOAD SHED CONTACTORS K5</strong></p>

<p>When the galley power option is installed, the galley load shed contactors control the application and removal of electrical power to the galleys.
Each contactor box has a normally open galley contactor with a 50 A two-pole single throw (2PST) contact arrangement.</p>

<p>The galley load shed contactors are energized to supply electrical power to the galley busses when the ac busses are energized by their related generator or external power.</p>

<p>A malfunction of one ac generator will cause the two galley load contactors to de-energize and open circuit the ac busses and the galley busses.</p>
