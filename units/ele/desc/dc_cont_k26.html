<p><strong>DC CONTACTOR K26</strong></p>

<p>K26 is activated closed when the APU GEN toggle switch input to the APU GCU is energized.</p>

<p>When the APU GCU senses a APU starter/generator malfunction, it will cause the bus contactor, K26 to open circuit the APU starter/generator.
</p>

<p>When the current from the APU starter/generator is more than 700 A for more than 5 seconds, the EPCU sends a trip signal to the related APU GCU to de-energize its DC starter/generator and open its related bus-tie contactor, K26.</p>
