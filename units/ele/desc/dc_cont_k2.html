<p><strong>DC CONTACTOR K2</strong></p>

<p>K2 is activated closed when the DC GEN 2 toggle switch input to the DC GCU is energized.</p>

<p>When the DC GCU senses a DC starter/generator malfunction, it will cause the bus contactor, K2 to open circuit the DC starter/generator.</p>

<p>When the current from the DC starter/generator is more than 700 A for more than 5 seconds, the EPCU sends a trip signal to the related DC GCU to de-energize its DC starter/generator and open its related bus-tie contactor, K2.</p>
