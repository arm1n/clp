<p><strong>AC Contactor Box</strong></p>

<p>The Left AC Contactor Box (LACCB) and Right AC Contactor Box (RACCB) are assemblies that are used to distribute and control the three−phase ac power. The ACCBs contain monitor and protection components in a protected environment. The box cover allows access to the internal Line Replaceable Units (LRUs).</p>

<p>Generator bus Contactor: Two ac generator bus contactors connect the ac generator three−phase output between their related or opposite busses.</p>

<p>When the galleys are installed, the LACCB and RACCB have galley contactors to energize the galley buses. The galley contactor K5 with its related connectors and circuit breakers are located in the LACCB and galley contactor K6 with related connectors and circuit breakers are located in the RACCB.</p>
