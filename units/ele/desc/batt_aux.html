<p><strong>AUX BATTERY</strong></p>

<p>The AUX BATTERY is a self contained power source that operates in charge and the discharge modes. 
The battery has nickel and cadmium (NiCad) plates with potassium hydroxide electrolyte. The NiCad battery has relatively constant voltage for most of the discharge condition.</p>

<p>The battery has two independent internal sensors that sense battery temperature. A Resistive Temperature Device (RTD) thermal sensor is used to measure the battery temperature for an EIS indication and a bi-metalic temperature switch is used to sense a temperature exceedance for a warning indication. </p>

<p>During an engine start condition, the standby battery is disconnected from the main feeder bus, but stays  connected to the essential busses to maintain a minimum voltage level on the essential bus. </p>
