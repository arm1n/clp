<p><strong>Warm−Up Relay 3041-k7</strong></p>

<p>The WARM UP mode prevents thermal shocks to the windshield. To avoid this damage, the warm up relay decreases the electrical power supply to the windshield heaters by 50%. This is achieved when the WARM UP mode activates the warm−up relay which places both windshields in a serial connection. When the WARM UP mode is selected, each Anti−Ice Controller (AIC) uses the normal 
temperature sensor information to activate its related windshield heater.</p>
