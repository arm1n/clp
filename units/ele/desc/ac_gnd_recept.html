<p><strong>EXTERNAL AC POWER</strong></p>

<p>An ac external power receptacle and control circuitry allows the ac variable frequency system to be energized by an ac external power source while the aircraft is on the ground.</p>

<p>The ac external power energizes the 115 Vac variable frequency if no aircraft power source is available.</p>

<p>The Electrical Power Protection Unit (EPPU) monitors the ac external power supplied to the ac busses (voltage and frequency). The busses then supply ac power to the transformer rectifier unit secondary windings, which are part of the dc generation system to energize the main 28 Vdc system.</p>

<p>A toggle switch located on the ac control panel in the flight compartment gives manual control of the ac external power system. An external ac ground service power toggle switch selection at the ac power receptacle panel causes ac external power to energize the galley and lavatory water heaters. The Engine and System Integrated Display (ESID) system shows ac external power indications.</p>
