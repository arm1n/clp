<p><strong>DC CONTACTOR K8</strong></p>


<p>The K8 contactor connects the main battery to the right main feeder bus. The contactor is closed by switching 28 Vdc through the battery master and main battery toggle switches. </p>

<p>The contactor is prevented from closing if the EPCU senses an over current condition sent by the opposite 
DC GCU for 1 second or from the related DC GCU for 5 seconds or an emergency condition is sensed.</p>

<clp-text-blue><strong>NOTE:</strong> The EPCU has an electromechanical relay with normally closed contacts to bypass the EPCU and let the pilots operate K8 when the EPCU is de-energized.</clp-text-blue>
