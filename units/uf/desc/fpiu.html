<p><strong>Flap Position Indicator Unit (FPIU)</strong></p>


<p>The FPIU supplies flap position data to the flight compartment indicator and interfaces with other aircraft systems. The FPIU is divided into two separate and independent analog channels (Left and Right) on a single printed circuit board. </p>

<div>Each channel in the FPIU performs the functions that follow:</div>
<ul>
	<li>Gives flapposition indication to the IFC and the FCECU</li>
	<li>Interfaceswith, and supplies electrical excitation to the flap position RVDT </li>
	<li>Demodulates the signal from the flap position RVDT</li>
	<li>Performs an analog monitor of its applicable RVDT</li>
	<li>Supplies a signals to the SPM 1-2 and ADU 1-2</li>
</ul>



<p>Each SPM receives two analog DC signals from the left and right channels of the Flap Position Interface Unit (FPIU). The signals relate to the left and right flap positions.
In addition, each Stall Protection Module (SPM1, SPM2) receives a FLAP HEALTHY discrete signal from the left and right channels of the FPIU when the system is serviceable.</p>
