<p><strong>AC GENERATOR CONTROL UNITS</strong></p>

<p>Each AC GCU automatically controls operation of its ac generator by monitoring output voltage, current, and speed. The AC GCU regulates its generator output and controls the operation of its bus contactor.</p>

<p>When the AC GCU senses an ac generator malfunction, it will cause the bus contactor to move to a cross-tie position to connect its bus to the other ac generator.</p>

<p>When source or bus faults occur, the contactors open, and stay open until the ac GCU is reset to prevent a reconnection to a fault condition. The GEN toggle switch on the ac control panel is set to the OFF position and then back to GEN to reset the ac GCU.</p>
