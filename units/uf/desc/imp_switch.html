<p><strong>Impact Switch</strong></p>


<p>The inertia switch supplies the SSFDR system with the capability to remove power from the system if an acceleration of greater than 5.5 g is applied to the switch as a consequence of high impact landing. This makes sure that SSFDR recorded data prior to the impact is stored and cannot be overwritten.</p>

<p>When the aircraft exceeds the preset acceleration level, the inertia switch will latch to its open circuit state and automatically stop the SSCVR from functioning.</p>
