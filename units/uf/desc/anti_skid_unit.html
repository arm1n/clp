<p><strong>ANTIâˆ’SKID CONTROL UNIT</strong></p>


<p>The Anti Skid Control Unit (ASCU) receives wheel speed information from the wheel speed
transducers to sense wheel deceleration. When a skid is sensed, the ASCU sends a signal to the
skid control valve to release the brake pressure to the non-rotating wheel.</p>

<p>The ASCU is an electronic box that has two wheel control circuit boards, one for the inboard
wheels and one for the outboard wheels.</p>

<p>The wheel control boards in the ASCU receive Weight-On-Wheel (WOW) and gear up and locked
signals from the PSEU, as well as, wheel speed information from the wheel speed transducers to
determine when touchdown protection is to be provided.</p>

<p>The ASCU sends signals to the Caution and Warning light and Advisory system and the Central
Diagnostic System to show and record faults in the system.</p>
