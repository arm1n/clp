<p><strong>High Level Control Unit</strong></p>

<p>The High Level Control Unit (HLCU) monitors the high level sensors and transmits a signal 
to prevent overfilling the tanks during refuel or fuel transfer operations. This unit also serves 
as a signal conditioner for the temperature sensor.
</p>


<p>The high level control unit is located below the passenger compartment floor. The pre-check 
test switch on the refuel/defuel control panel tests the automatic shutoff operation of the 
high level control unit.</p>

<p>The HLCU does a continuous BIT on itself and the high level sensor. Any fault sensed will 
stop the refueling procedure.</p>

<p>The high level control unit is powered by the essential bus and the battery bus.</p>
