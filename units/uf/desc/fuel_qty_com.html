<p><strong>Fuel Quantity Computer</strong></p>

<p>The Fuel Quantity Computer (FQC) performs these functions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Calculates the <clp-text-blue><b>fuel quantities</b></clp-text-blue> in each tank independently</li>
	<li>Controls the <clp-text-blue><b>level control solenoid</b></clp-text-blue> for preselect refueling (automatic mode)</li>
	<li>Performs a Built-In Test (BIT) of the fuel gauging components</li>
	<li>Sends quantity, temperature, and BIT data to the Refuel/Defuel Indicator (RDI)</li>
	
</ul>

<p>The Fuel Quantity Computer (FQC) is located in the avionics bay below the passenger 
compartment floor. The FQC has two independent processors. Both processors are 
interconnected through a data link to provide redundancy for fuel quantity indications. 
Each of these processors performs the functions listed in the paragraph above. </p>

<p>The right processor also calculates fuel temperature measurements and transmits the 
information to the MFD. The FQC performs an initial BIT when it starts up and a 
continuous BIT when it is in operation.</p>
