<p><strong>Timer Monitor Control Unit (TMCU)</strong></p>


<p>The Timer Monitor Control Unit (TMCU) distributes electrical heating power 
to the propellers to give correct ice shedding under the different 
atmospheric conditions. It also monitors the propeller heaters for open or 
short circuits.</p>

<p>There are two identical Timer Monitor Control Units (TMCUs), 
one for each propeller. Power is supplied to the heater in a cyclic sequence 
by the Timer Monitor Control Unit (TMCU) with the ’on’ time set, which 
weakens the ice bond and allows the lower centrifugal forces to displace 
the ice. The ’off’ period time allows a small layer of ice to build up and give 
a mass that can be shed during the on cycle.</p>

<p>The TMCU has discrete solid state power switches for cycling power from a three phase variable frequency 115 Vac supply to deice elements installed on the propeller blades. For safety reasons, an aircraft-mounted isolation contactor is placed between the three phase power supply from the TMCU and propeller 
when deicing is not demanded or if there is a potentially damaging failure. The TMCU con- trols the operation of the contactor. The contactor coil can 
only be enabled when the propeller heat switch is set to the ON or TEST 
position.</p>

<div>The Timer Monitor Control Unit (TMCU) activates the propeller blade 
heaters when the conditions that follow are met:</div>

<ul>
	<li>Total Air Temperature (TAT) must be at or below 41 °F (5 °C)</li>
	<li>Propeller is rotating (Np) greater than 400 rpm</li>
	<li>Propeller Heater Control Switch must be ON</li>
	
</ul>
