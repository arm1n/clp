<p><strong>Isolation Contactor</strong></p>


<p>For safety reasons, an air- craft-mounted isolation contactor is placed 
between the three phase power supply from the TMCU and propeller 
when deicing is not demanded or if there is a potentially damaging failure. </p>

<p>The TMCU controls the operation of the contactor. The contactor coil can 
only be enabled when the propeller heat switch is set to the ON or 
TEST position.</p>
