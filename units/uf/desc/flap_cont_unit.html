<p><strong>Unit, Flap Control (FCU)</strong></p>

<p>The Flap Control Unit (FCU) is a microprocessor-based controller. The FCU performs the functions that follow:</p>


	<ul>
		<li>Processes the signals from the flap position and flap lever transducers to monitor the actual flap position and controls the flap movement to the new position</li>
		<li>Receives pressure ON/OFF signal from the pressure switch in the flap power unit</li>
		<li>Receives the enabling signal from the arming switch on the flap lever transducer</li>
		<li>Performs internal checks to monitor the FCU for faults (Built In Test)</li>
		<li>Receives the Weight On Wheels signal to inhibit the power to the Built In Test (BIT) mode during flight</li>
		<li>Performs internal checks to monitor the FCU for faults</li>
		<li>Performs asymmetry and non-selected flap movement monitoring</li>
		<li>Supplies the ON/OFF power signal to the flap power unit solenoid valve</li>
		<li>Supplies controlled current to the FPU electro-hydraulic solenoid valve to actuate the system</li>
		<li>Supplies the FLAP POWER and FLAP DRIVE signals to the aircraft indicating and monitoring system</li>
		<li>Supplies the flap selected position to the indication and monitoring system</li>
		<li>Supplies the system status information through the ARINC 429 link and the RS422 serial port</li>
	</ul>
