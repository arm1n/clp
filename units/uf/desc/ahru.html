<p><strong>AHRS</strong></p>


<p>The Attitude and Heading Reference System calculates and supplies primary attitude and heading data for indication and for use by different systems.The Attitude and Heading System (AHRS1,AHRS2) data are monitored by each SPM. The AHRS data is non-critical for the SPS. If the AHRS data to the related SPM is not correct, it will use data from the other AHRS.If the two AHRS malfunction, the stick shakers and stick pusher continue to operate in flight.</p>

<clp-text-blue>Malfunctions of non-critical parameters are not shown in flight. The #1 STALL SYST FAIL or #2 STALL SYST FAIL caution light will come on 30 seconds after the aircraft has landed.</clp-text-blue>

<div>Each Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS1, AHRS 2) has the units that follow:</div>
<ul>
	<li>Attitude and Heading Reference Units (AHRU1,AHRU2)</li>
	<li>Flux Valves</li>
	<li>AHRS Control Panel (AHCP1, AHCP2)</li>
	<li>Remote Memory Module (RMM1, RMM2)</li>
</ul>



<p>Each AHRS does an alignment when the AHRU is energized after a long power intruption or if the mode is set with an AHCP ALIGN selection. After the alignment is compeleted, AHRS operates in the normal mode for attitude if it receives TAS from one or the other ADS. The AHRS also operates in the slaved mode for heading if it receives heading data from the related flux valve.<br>
If a TAS airspeed data is not available, the attitude mode automati- cally changes to the degraded basic mode. If the flux valve data is not available, the heading mode malfuctions. An AHCP DC selection man- ually sets a degraded directional gyro mode and the slew pushbutton switches are then used to correct the EIS heading indication.<br>
The compass calibration mode is used to calibrate the slaved heading mode while the aircraft is on the ground. The mode is set when the ALIGN and DG pushbutton switches located on the AHCP are pushed at the same time.</p>
