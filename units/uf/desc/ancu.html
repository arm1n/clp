<p><strong>Active Noise Control Unit (ANCU)</strong></p>

<p>The controller processes the propeller frequency data and the cabin noise levels from the sensors. The outputs are control signals that go to the actuators through the power amplifiers.</p>

<div>A secondary function of the ANVS is to record and process propeller balance data as follows:</div>
<ul>
	<li>Vibration data is collected from a vibration transducer mounted on each propeller gearbox</li>
	<li>Vibration data is collected automatically during flight or with the PBMS terminal during an engine ground run. The data is read from the controller with the PBMS terminal software</li>
	<li>The PBMS terminal software automatically calculates and stores the vibration data necessary to make sure of the level of propeller unbalance during usual revenue flight operations</li>
	<li>The PBMS terminal software then calculates the propeller balance data. This is used to calculate the redistribution of weights in the propeller balance plane necessary for propeller balance in the specified limits during ground maintenance</li>

</ul>
