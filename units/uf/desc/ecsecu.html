<p><strong>Enviromental Control System Electronic Control Unit (ECU)</strong></p>


<p>The ECU consists of a left digital channel with a left backup analog channel and a right digital channel with a right backup analog channel. The left digital/analog channel controls the left side and the right digital/analog channel the right side. The digital channels monitor the bleed protective sensors to maintain the correct temperature, pressure, flow rates and valve positions during normal operation. If one of the protective sensors exceed certain values, the ECU automatically shuts the system down.</p>

<p>The ECU responds to selections from BLEED 1 and 2 switches on the AIR CONDITIONING panel to configure the Bleed Air System for bleed source selection. The ECU and the Bleed Air System have redundant configurations to permit continued ECS operation with mechanical and electrical component malfunctions.</p>
