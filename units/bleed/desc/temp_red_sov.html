<p><strong>Valve, Temperature Reduction Shutoff</strong></p>

<p>The temperature reduction shutoff valve is a pneumatically actuated, solenoid-controlled gate type device that opens to recirculate secondary heat exchanger air, back into the primary heat exchanger inlet. This is done when the temperature at the primary heat exchanger inlet is too hot.</p>

<p>The temperature reduction shutoff valve is installed on the aft side of the heat exchanger.</p>
