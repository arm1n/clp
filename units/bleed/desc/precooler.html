<p><strong>Precooler</strong></p>

<p>The precooler is installed near the top of the engine. It is a two-part plate and fin, cross flow, air to air heat exchanger which uses low temperature (P2.2) bleed air to cool high pressure bleed air. 
The main heat exchanger cools the temperature of the high pressure (P3.0) bleed air before it is supplied to the ECS. The small heat exchanger cools either the high pressure (P3.0) or the low pressure (P2.7) bleed air before it is supplied to the deice system. </p>
