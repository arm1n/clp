<p><strong>Wing Differential Pressure Sensor</strong></p>

<p>
The wing differential pressure sensor is installed on a bracket in the wing leading edge and is connected to bleed air ducting with rigid tubing. The differential pressure sensor has two pressure ports. 
</p>

<p>One port senses the pressure upstream of the wing venturi and the other port senses the pressure at the throat of the venturi. The differential pressure data is sent to the ECU. The ECU uses this data together with pressure and temperature data to regulate the bleed air flow through the nacelle shutoff valve.  </p>
