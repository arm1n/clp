<p><strong>Machine, Air Cycle</strong></p>

<p>The air cycle machine is a 3-wheeled, air bearing device that provides cooling of the warm bleed air. There are three rotors in each ACM: a compressor, a turbine and a fan. The rotors are held together with interference fits on shaft segments so the three rotors turn together. The ACM compresses the air (compressor section) and then expands it (turbine section). The expansion of the air causes a decrease in temperature. The fan section draws cooling air through the dual heat exchanger during ground operations.

<p>There are two air cycle machines which are located below the fan inlet diffuser housing.</p>
