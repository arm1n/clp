<p><strong>APU BLEED VALVE</strong></p>

<p>The bleed valve is an electro−pneumatic butterfly valve that is normally closed. The valve is located on the APU combustor housing bleed air duct and controlled by the FADEC. FADEC receives a signal from the BL AIR switch on the APU control panel.
The FADEC uses signals from the APU exhaust thermocouples to control the Bleed Valve during bleed air delivery.</p>

<p>If the APU exhaust gas temperature (EGT) reaches 692 °C the Bleed Valve will be modulated to reduce bleed air flow. This gives maximum air flow delivery without exceeding the APU exhaust gas temperature limits. Modulating bleed air flow in response to exhaust gas temperature limits lets generator loads have priority over bleed air delivery.</p>
