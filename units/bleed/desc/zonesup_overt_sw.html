<p><strong>Zone Supply Overtemperature Switches</strong></p>

<p>The zone supply overtemperature switches are installed in the cabin and flight compartment supply ducts under the aft baggage compartment floor (Stn X 765). These ducts supply conditioned air from the air conditioning system to the flight and cabin compartments (refer to SDS 21−21−00 and 21−22−00).
</p>

<p>The zone supply overtemperature switches send a discrete signal to the ECU if the temperature in either supply duct is greater than 190 °F (87.8 °C). This signal causes the ECU to turn on the related CABIN DUCT HOT or FLT COMP DUCT HOT caution light on the caution and warning panel. The ECU also shuts off the related air conditioning pack (by closing the turbine and ACM bypass shutoff valves).</p>
