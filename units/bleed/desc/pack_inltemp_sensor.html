<p><strong>Sensor, Pack Inlet Temperature</strong></p>

<p>The pack inlet temperature sensor is a dual resistive temperature device (RTD) that supplies two independent temperature signals to the ECU (one to each digital channel). The pack inlet temperature sensor is installed in the air conditioning ducting in the aft fuselage. It senses the temperature of the bleed air as it flows into the air conditioning pack. The ECU uses this temperature data to determine the bleed air flow rate.
