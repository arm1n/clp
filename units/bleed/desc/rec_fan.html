<p><strong>Fan, Recirculation</strong></p>

<p>The recirculation fan, located on the right side of the air conditioning pack, draws cabin air through the recirculation headers just above the floor. The air is routed under the floor then to the rear pressure bulkhead, where it is mixed with pack conditioned air. The recirculation ducting contains a check valve that prevents reverse flow through the fan in flight or during pack operation.

<p>The recirculation fan switch controls the on/off operation of the recirculation fan. </p>
