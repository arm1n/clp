<p><strong>Zone Supply Temperature Sensors</strong></p>

<p>The zone supply temperature sensors are dual thermistor sensors that supply independent signals to the digital and analog channels of the ECU. These sensors send supply duct temperature information to the ECU so it can control the temperature of the cabin and flight compartment.
</p>

<p>The zone supply temperature sensors are installed in the cabin and flight compartment supply ducts under the aft baggage compartment floor (Stn X 765). These ducts supply conditioned air from the air conditioning system to the flight and cabin compartments.</p>
