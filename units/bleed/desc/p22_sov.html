<p><strong>P2.2 Shutoff Valve</strong></p>

<p>The P2.2 shutoff valve is a pneumatically operated, torque motor actuated butterfly valve. The valve has a wire mesh filter upstream of the torque motor to protect the servo from contamination. 
The P2.2 shutoff valve is installed in line with the P2.2 low pressure ducting and the P2.2 inlet at the bottom of the precooler. It opens to supply cooling air through the precooler. 

</p>

<p>The precooler temperature switch (refer to 36-11-11) controls its operation. The valve has two closed position switches to supply valve position information to the ECU and to FADEC.</p>
