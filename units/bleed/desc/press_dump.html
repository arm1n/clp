<p><strong>Pressure Dump</strong></p>

<p>The fast depressurization function may be done in the automatic and the manual modes. The <b>AUTO/MAN/DUMP</b> switch set to <b>DUMP</b> fully opens the aft outflow valve. In the manual mode, the aft outflow valve opens when the toggle switch is moved and held in the DECR position. In <b>DUMP</b> mode the aft outflow valves stay fully open, preventing the aeroplane from pressurizing. <b>DUMP</b> mode may also be used for maximum smoke evacuation.
