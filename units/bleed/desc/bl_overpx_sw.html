<p><strong>Overpressure Switch</strong></p>

<p>The overpressure switch is installed on a bracket in the wing leading edge and is connected to the bleed air ducting with rigid tubing. It is a protective switch that monitors nacelle bleed pressure. 
If the pressure in the nacelle ducting is greater than 100 psi (690 kPa), the overpressure switch will close. 
This sends a signal to the ECU to close the affected nacelle shutoff valve. The ECU also sends a signal to turn on the appropriate BLEED HOT caution light.</p>
