<p><strong>Nozzles, Spray</strong></p>

<p>The spray nozzle is installed on the top left side of the ram air header duct. The nozzles spray water against the ram air inlet face of the dual heat exchanger. This water evaporates and improves the efficiency of the heat exchanger. 
Removal of the water from the system is important for extending the life of the air cycle machine.

</p>

<p>If the water cannot be removed from the air before it enters the ACM turbines, it causes turbine nozzle erosion, which degrades ACM performance and decreases its reliability.</p>
