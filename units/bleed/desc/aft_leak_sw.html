<p><strong>Aft Fuselage Duct Leak Overtemperature Switches</strong></p>

<p>Two aft fuselage duct leak overtemperature switches are installed on a bracket on the aft fuselage tee duct. 
They detect a bleed air leak in the engine or APU bleed air ducting near the air conditioning pack inlet. 
If the temperature in the ducting is greater than 360 °F (182.2 °C), the switch contacts will open. 
This sends a signal to the ECU to close the nacelle shutoff valve. 
</p>

<p>The ECU also sends a fault code to the Central Diagnostic System (CDS) identifying a duct leak.</p>
