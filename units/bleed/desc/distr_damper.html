<p><strong>Distribution Damper</strong></p>

<p>The distribution damper is an electronically controlled and electrically actuated valve.The right digital channel of the ECU automatically sets the distribution damper depending on the cabin supply duct temperature. During heating, 70% of the warm air goes to the lower vents and 30% to the overhead vents. During cooling, 70% of the cool air goes to the overhead vents and gaspers, and 30% to the lower vents. During standard temperatures, 50% of the air is directed to the overhead vents and 50% to the lower vents. </p>

<p>The right digital channel of the ECU controls the electric motor of the distribution damper valve. If the right digital channel or the electric motor fails, the damper valve will remain in its last position. Two position switches in the damper valve send discrete signals to the ECU indicating whether the valve is in the full warm of the full cool position.</p>
