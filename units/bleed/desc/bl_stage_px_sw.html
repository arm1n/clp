<p><strong>Bleed Stage Pressure Switch</strong></p>

<p>The bleed stage pressure switch is installed in a bracket aft of the precooler. The switch controls the HPSOV independently of the ECU for deice operation. 
The switch contacts close when the high stage (P3.0) pressure is less than 77 psi (531 kPa). The switch contacts open when P3.0 pressure is greater than 82 psi (565 kPa). When the bleed stage switch is closed (P3.0 < 77 psi (531 kPa)) and the deice system is selected on, the HPSOV will open to supply P3.0 air to the deice system.</p>

<p>A discrete signal from the deice system and an open discrete signal from the HPSOV identifies to the ECU that high stage (P3.0) bleed air is selected for deice use. The ECU adjusts bleed air flow as required.</p>
