<p><strong>Switch, Compressor Overtemperature</strong></p>

<p>The compressor overtemperature switch is mounted in the secondary heat exchanger inlet duct and monitors air flow temperature entering the secondary heat exchanger. It is a thermal switch which trips if the compressor outlet temperature exceeds 415 °F (212 °C). The ECU uses the signal from the switch to determine if the air conditioning pack should be turned off.  </p>
