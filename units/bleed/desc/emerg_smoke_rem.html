<p><strong>Emergency/Smoke Removal</strong></p>

<p>Pressurization can be controlled through the forward safety valve when the aft outflow valve becomes unserviceable. Cabin pressure can be regulated by turning the FWD OUTFLOW knob, as necessary, to adjust the amount of pressure bleed to get the required pressurization selection. When the control knob is turned clockwise the forward safety valve opens and the cabin pressure decreases. Pressurization can also be reduced rapidly by turning the forward safety valve selector on the copilot's side console. This opens the forward safety valve fully.</p>

<p><clp-text-blue><strong>NOTE:</strong> When operating in emergency mode, the cabin altitude, cabin differential pressure, and cabin rate of change indicators should be monitored carefully.</clp-text-blue></p>

<p>Electrical power is not required to operate either the FWD OUTFLOW knob, or the forward safety valve selector.</p>

<p>The forward safety valve may be used with the automatic system operating during flight to evacuate smoke from the flight deck, without depressurizing the airplane. Turning the <b>FWD OUTFLOW</b> knob clockwise meters suction caused by the slipstream to open the forward safety valve. With the <b>AUTO/MAN/DUMP</b> switch set to <b>AUTO</b>, the automatic system, trying to maintain cabin pressure, will begin to close the aft outflow valve. This exhausts air and smoke through the forward outflow valve.</p>
