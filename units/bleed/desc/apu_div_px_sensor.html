<p><strong>APU DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE SENSOR</strong></p>

<p>The APU differential pressure sensor is installed on a bracket on the APU bleed air ducting in the aft fuselage. It is connected to the bleed air ducting by rigid tubing. The differential pressure sensor has two pressure ports. One port senses the pressure upstream of the APU venturi and the other port senses the pressure at the throat of the venturi.</p>

<p>The differential pressure data is sent to the ECU. The ECU uses this data together with pressure and temperature data to regulate the bleed air flow through the pack flow control and shutoff valve.</p>
