<p><strong>SSwitch, Valve-Temperature Reduction</strong></p>

<p>The temperature reduction valve switch is a thermal switch which trips if the pack inlet temperature exceeds 560 °F (293 °C). This signal is used only for Built In Test (BIT). The ECU compares the signal from the temperature reduction valve switch with that from the pack inlet temperature sensor, to determine if the temperature reduction shutoff valve is operating correctly. </p>

<p>The temperature reduction valve switch is installed on the bleed air inlet ducting in the aft fuselage.</p>
