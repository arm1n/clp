<p><strong>Overtemperature Switch/SENSOR</strong></p>

<p>The overtemperature switch is installed in the precooler outlet duct. It is a protective switch that monitors nacelle bleed air temperature. If the temperature of the bleed air entering the nacelle ducts is greater than 660°F (349 °C), the overtemperature switch will open. This sends a signal to the ECU to close the nacelle shutoff valve for the affected side. The ECU will then turn on the appropriate BLEED HOT caution light. </p>

<p>On aircraft with ModSum 4Q113658 or SB84−36−03 incorporated, the overtemperature switch is replaced with a sensor. This sensor is a Resistance Temperature Device (RTD). It gives a resistance, which is proportional to the temperature it senses. If the temperature of the bleed air entering the nacelle ducts is greater than 660°F (349 °C), the overtemperature sensor sends a signal to the ECU to close the nacelle shutoff valve for the affected side. The ECU will then turn on the appropriate BLEED HOT caution light. </p>
