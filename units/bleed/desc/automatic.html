<p><strong>Automatic</strong></p>

<p>When electrical power is first supplied to the system, a full power up self test is done. The <b>FAULT</b> alert light, on the Cabin Pressure Control (CPC) panel comes on momentarily during the power up test mode. If there is a failure in the system, the light will stay on. The system operation is fully automatic with the data programmed into the controller.</p>

<p>
With the system in <b>AUTO</b> mode, a preprogrammed cabin pressure controller does all pressure scheduling from take-off to landing with minimal crew input. The computer receives inputs from the crew and various aeroplane systems, and modulates the aft outflow valve. This keeps a fixed schedule of cabin altitude versus airplane altitude for complete regulation of cabin pressure.</p>
