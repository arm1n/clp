<p><strong>Wing Duct Check Valve</strong></p>

<p>The wing duct check valve is a dual flapper, spring loaded check valve. The valve is installed in the bleed air ducting along the wing leading edge. It is held open by bleed air from the engine. The check valve closes during single engine operation to prevent bleed air from the operating engine flowing into the bleed air ducting of the opposite engine. The check valve also prevents reverse flow into both engine bleed air systems when the APU is supplying the bleed air.
