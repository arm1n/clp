<p>To ensure safety for overpressure relief and negative pressure relief. The aft safety valve opens on the ground 
with the power lever below 60 and when there is a bleed air source.</p>

<p>The aft safety valve is located on the aft pressure bulkhead.The aft safety valve is the same as the forward 
safety valve, but has a solenoid valve instead of a pneumatic relay.The aft safety valve automatically releases 
the cabin pressure when preset overpressure pressure limits are approached. The cabin pres- sure is applied 
to the inside of the manometric capsule. The poppet/diaphragm assembly releases the cabin pressure through 
the overpressure relief valve to atmosphere.When the check valve opens, the cabin pressure of the 
poppet/diaphragm assembly starts to flow out to outside static pressure through the now open center of 
the aft safety valve.</p>

<p>The reduced pressure in the back chamber of the poppet/diaphragm assembly forces the poppet/diaphragm to 
oppose the spring and opens the poppet/diaphragm assembly. The cabin air flows out.The safety valves also 
have a negative pressure relief function. During an emergency descent or without cabin airflow, the outside 
static pressure becomes more than the cabin pressure.The force of the cabin pressure applied on one side of 
the poppet/diaphragm assembly is less than the force of the outside static pressure and the spring on the other 
side of the poppet/diaphragm assembly.The differential pressure between the outside and the cabin moves the 
deflector and the poppet/diaphragm assembly opens.The air in the chamber is released into the cabin. 
The outside air flows into the cabin and the cabin pressure increases.</p>
