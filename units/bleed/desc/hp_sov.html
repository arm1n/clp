<p><strong>High Pressure Shutoff Valve </strong></p>

<p>The high pressure shutoff valve (HPSOV) is a pneumatically operated, torque 
motor actuated butterfly valve. The HPSOV is installed in line with the high 
pressure ducting between the engine (P3.0) bleed air port and the pre-cooler. 
The high pressure ducting in the nacelle is enclosed in a composite shroud 
from the bleed port to the HPSOV. <br>This reduces the possibility of ignition in the 
event of a fuel spillage. The valve has a wire mesh filter upstream of the 
torque motor to protect the servo from contamination. The HPSOV opens when
the torque motor is energized. When the HPSOV is in the open position, it allows P3.0 air to flow through to the pre-cooler to supply the ECS and/or the deice systems. The ECU uses high pressure (P3.0) information supplied by FADEC to control the opening and closing of the HPSOV. The ECU opens the HPSOV at low engine power settings.<br> The HPSOV has a closed position
switch which informs the ECU of the status of the valve. The bleed stage 
pressure switch can open the HPSOV independently from the ECU to supply 
bleed air to the deice system.</p>
