<p><strong>Power Quadrant</strong></p>


<div><b>On Ground mode:</b></div>
<p>When the aircraft is on the ground with the weight on the wheels and the engine power lever angles are set at less than 60 degrees, electrical power is supplied through the open contacts of the energized landing gear relay. The relay is energized through the Proximity Sensor Electronic Unit (PSEU). During the ground mode the controller holds the outflow valve fully open position to prevent aircraft pressurization. In addition, it signals the aft safety valve to open. The valve will open if there is bleed air pressure available to drive the jet pump.</p>

<div><b>Take-off (Pre-Pressurization mode):</b></div>
<p>When the #2 power lever angle is set to greater than 60 degrees, the controller sends a signal to the outflow valve to close, as necessary, to pressurize the aircraft to 400 ft. (121.9 m) less than ambient to avoid a pressure bump on aircraft rota- tion. When the PSEU indicates that the aircraft is airborne, the outflow valve modulates to keep the set aircraft pressurization schedule. Take-off (Take-off abort mode): The cabin pressure controller is in the take-off mode 10 minutes after lift off. The CPC memorizes the take-off altitude for 10 minutes in case there is an aborted flight and emergency return to the departure airport is necessary. This avoids the requirement to reselect the landing altitude.</p>

<div><b>Aft Safety Valve</b></div>
<p>To ensure safety for overpressure relief and negative pressure relief. The aft safety valve opens on the ground with the power lever below 60 and when there is a bleed air source.</p>
