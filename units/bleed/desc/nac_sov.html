<p><strong>Nacelle Shutoff Valve</strong></p>

<p>The nacelle shutoff valve is a pneumatically operated, torque motor actuated butterfly valve. The nacelle shutoff valve is installed in line with the precooler outlet duct and the wing ducting. The valve has a wire mesh filter upstream of the torque motor to protect the servo from contamination. </p>



<p>Selection of the BLEED 1 and/or BLEED 2 switches on the AIR CONDITIONING control panel opens the related nacelle shutoff valve. The ECU uses the nacelle shutoff valve to control the flow of bleed air to the ECS. The ECU regulates the nacelle shutoff valve according to the settings of the BLEED, PACKS and MIN/NORM/MAX switches on the AIR CONDITIONING control panel.</p>

<p>The ECU also regulates the nacelle shutoff valve in each nacelle to supply 50% of the total flow demand. This ensures equal flow sharing between each main engine. The nacelle shutoff valve has a closed position switch which informs the ECU of the status of the valve.
