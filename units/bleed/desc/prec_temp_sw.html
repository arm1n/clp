<p><strong>Precooler Temperature Switch</strong></p>

<p>The precooler temperature switch is installed in the ducting between the HPSOV and the precooler. 
The precooler switch monitors the temperature of the engine bleed air entering the precooler. </p>

<p>If the bleed air entering the precooler is greater than 550°F (288 °C), the switch will open sending a signal 
to the ECU to open the P2.2 shutoff valve. This allows cooling P2.2 air to pass through the precooler. </p>
