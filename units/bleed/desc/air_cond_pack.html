<p><strong>AIR CONDITIONING PACK</strong></p>

<p>The air conditioning pack conditions the bleed air to the proper temperature and humidity and delivers it to the air distribution system for environmental control of the cabin and flight compartment.</p>

<p>The air conditioning pack is part of the Environmental Control System (ECS). It uses bleed air from the engines or Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) to supply conditioned air to the cabin and flight compartment.</p>

<p>The system responds to flight crew commands and compartment temperature controls to supply a comfortable temperature environment for passengers and crew. Two air cycle machines (ACM), with one dual heat exchanger located in the aft fuselage, cool the bleed air coming from the two engines. This configuration provides the redundancy of two packs while allowing access to a much larger dual heat exchanger during operation with a single ACM.</p>
