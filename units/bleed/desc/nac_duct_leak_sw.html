<p><strong>Nacelle Duct Leak Overtemperature Switch</strong></p>

<p>The nacelle duct leak overtemperature switch is installed in a bracket next to the nacelle shutoff valve. 
It detects a bleed air leak in the nacelle ducting. If the temperature in the nacelle ducting is greater than 360 °F (182.2 °C), the switch opens sending a signal to the ECU to close the appropriate nacelle SOV. 
The ECU also sends a fault code to the Central Diagnostic System (CDS) identifying a duct leak.
