<p><strong>Manual</strong></p>

<p>The manual mode is used if the automatic pressurization mode does not operate. Pressuriza- tion can be manually controlled through the aft outflow valve, when the <b>AUTO/MAN/DUMP</b> switch is set to <b>MAN</b>. When the toggle switch is moved and held to the <b>DECR</b> position, the aft outflow valve opens and decreases the cabin pressure, increasing the cabin altitude. When the toggle switch is moved and held to INCR, the aft outflow valve closes and the cabin pressure increases to decrease the cabin altitude.</p>

<p><clp-text-blue><strong>NOTE:</strong> When operating in manual mode, the cabin altitude, cabin differential pressure, and cabin rate of change indicators should be monitored carefully.</clp-text-blue></p>
