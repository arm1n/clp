<p><strong>Valve, Pack Bypass</strong></p>

<p>The pack bypass valve is an electrically-controlled, pneumatic valve, which controls the pack discharge temperature for all operating conditions. The valve opens to let warm bleed air go to the ACM turbine outlet when warmer air is needed.</p>

<duv>The valve consists of:</duv>
<ul>
	<li>Torque motor </li>
	<li>Pneumatic actuator</li>
	<li>Butterfly valve</li>
</ul>

<br>
<p>The valve is fitted with a metal wire mesh filter in the servo air line, to prevent contamination from entering the torque motor and pneumatic actuator. The valve also has a locking pin that, when in the locked position, bleeds servo air to ambient and mechanically locks the valve in the closed position. The pack (ACM) bypass valves are located between the bleed air inlet and the ACM turbine outlets. The valve is used to regulate the temperature of conditioned air sent to the cabin and flight compartments.</p>
