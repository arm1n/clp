<p><strong>Condenser/Reheater/Mixer</strong></p>

<p>(ACM compressor) air from the secondary heat exchanger. The mixer circuit contains the cool air from the ACM turbines and the recirculated air from the cabin and flight compartment. The air in this circuit is cool enough to condense the water vapour from the surrounding air. The condensed water then goes to the water collector. After passing through the condenser, this air in the mixer circuit is delivered to the cabin and flight compartment. The reheater circuit contains the air that is downstream of the water collector. 
</p>

<p>This air is reheated before it is delivered to the ACM turbine inlet. The condenser/reheater/mixer is located at the bottom of the air conditioning pack.</p>
