<p><strong>Collector, Water</strong></p>

<p>The water collector is installed on the left side of the condenser and removes water from the bleed air. It has swirl vanes which use centrifugal action to push the condensed water to its inside walls. The water goes out through a tube to the spray nozzle, for spray against the ram inlet face of the dual heat exchanger. A small overflow provides an outlet for excess water.
