<p><strong>Cabin Zone Temperature and Temp.Indication Sensor</strong></p>

<p>The three zone temperature sensors measure the temperature of the air in the cabin and in the flight compartment zones. The ECU uses two of the three zone temperature sensor signals to control the conditioned air temperature.</p>

<p>The ECU keeps the temperature in the cabin and flight compartments between 59 and 80.6 °F (15 and 27.0 °C). The third zone temperature sensor (in the cabin compartment) is an indication sensor. It supplies the cabin temperature signal to the DUCT TEMP gauge on the AIR CONDITIONING control panel and to the temperature gauge on the flight attendant’s panel.</p>
