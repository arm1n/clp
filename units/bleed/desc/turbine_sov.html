<p><strong>Valve, Turbine Shutoff</strong></p>

<p>The turbine shutoff valve is an electrically-controlled, pneumatic valve that opens to allow air into the ACM turbine.</p>

<div>The valve consists of: </div>
<ul>
	<li>Torque motor</li>
	<li>Pneumatic actuator</li>
	<li>Position switch</li>
	<li>Butterfly valve</li>
</ul>

<p>The valve has a metal wire mesh filter in the servo air line to prevent contamination from entering the torque motor and pneumatic actuator. The valve also has a locking pin that, when in the locked position, bleeds servo air to ambient and mechanically locks the valve in the closed position.<br>
The turbine shutoff valves are located between the condenser/reheater/mixer and the ACM turbine inlets.
