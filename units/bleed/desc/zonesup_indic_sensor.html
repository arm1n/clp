<p><strong>Zone Supply Indication Sensor</strong></p>

<p>The two zone supply indication sensors are located in the flight compartment and cabin supply ducts near the zone supply temperature sensors. These indication sensors send the supply duct temperature signals to the DUCT TEMP gauge on the AIR CONDITIONING control panel (refer to 21–61–06).
</p>

<p>These temperature signals are supplied to the gauge independent of the Environmental Control Unit (ECU).</p>

<div>The flight crew can select the two temperatures for display on the DUCT TEMP gauge:</div>
<ul>
	<li>CABIN (supply) DUCT</li>
	<li>FLT COMP (supply) DUCT</li>
	
</ul>
