<p><strong>Forward Safety Valve</strong></p>

<p>The valve operation can be controlled manually by rotating the FWD Outflow knob on the Cabin Pressure 
Control Panel clockwise or by raising the safety guard and turning the Forward Safety Valve Selector on the 
Coâ€“Pilot side panel clockwise.</p>

<div><b>Forward Safety Valve Operation</b></div>
<p>Pressurization can be controlled through the forward safety valve. Cabin pressure can be regulated by turning 
the FWD OUTFLOW knob, as necessary, to adjust the amount of pressurization bleed to get the required 
pressurization selection.<br>
When the control knob is turned clockwise the forward safety valve opens and the cabin pressure decreases. 
Pressurization can also be decreased by operating the forward safety valve selector on the copilot's side console.</p>

<div><b>Emergency/Smoke Removal Mode</b></div>
<p>The forward safety valve may be used (with the automatic system operating during flight) to evacuate smoke 
from the flight compartment. If the AUTO/MAN/DUMP switch is set in automatic mode, and the FWD OUTFLOW knob is turned to open the forward safety valve, the cabin pressure will decrease and the aft outflow valve will start to close. 
</p>

<p>When the FWD OUTFLOW knob is set to a higher cabin altitude (lower cabin pressure) than that set in 
automatic mode, it will override the automatic selection. This exhausts air and smoke through the forward 
safety valve.</p>
