<p><strong>Sensor, Outlet Temperature-Secondary Heat Exchanger</strong></p>

<p>The secondary heat exchanger outlet temperature sensor is installed in the secondary heat exchanger outlet duct and senses the temperature of the air leaving the heat exchanger. This signal is used only for Built In Test (BIT). The ECU compares the signal from this switch, to the signal from the compressor inlet temperature sensor, to determine whether the dual heat exchanger is operating efficiently.
