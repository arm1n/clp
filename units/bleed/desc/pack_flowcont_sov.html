<p><strong>Valve, Pack Flow Control and Shutoff</strong></p>

<p>The pack flow control and shutoff valve is a pneumatically operated, torque motor actuated butterfly valve. It has a position switch that indicates to the ECU when the valve is closed. The valve has a wire mesh screen upstream of the torque motor to protect the servo parts from contamination. The pack flow control and shutoff valve is installed in line with the air conditioning ducting in the aft fuselage.
</p>

<p>It controls bleed air flow to the air conditioning pack according to the demands of the Environmental Control System (ECS). If a mechanical malfunction occurs in the pack flow control and shutoff valve, it defaults pneumatically to the open position to permit continued ECS operation. The pack flow control and shutoff valve defaults electrically to the closed position to stop ECS operation.</p>

<p>This electrical default can occur only if both digital channels of the ECU lose power or fail. If this occurs, air is supplied to the cabin and flight compartments by emergency ram air.
