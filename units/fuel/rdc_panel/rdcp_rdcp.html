<h3>REFUEL/DEFUEL INDICATOR (RDI)</h3>


<p><strong>
		<clp-text-blue>TANK ACTUAL FUEL QUANTITY INDICATION</clp-text-blue>
	</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>The fuel quantity of each tank is shown on the refuel/defuel panel FUEL QUANTITY INDICATIOR.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>
		<clp-text-blue>TEST/RESET SWITCH</clp-text-blue> (three position, spring loaded to center)
	</strong></p>
<p><strong>TEST POSITION</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>starts display test</li>
	<li>displays a checkerboard pattern for 2 ± 1 seconds, followed by an inverse checker-board pattern for 2 ± 1 seconds and finally, followed by all segments turned off for 2 ± 1 seconds</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>RESET POSITION</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>for maintenance purposes</li>
	<li>selecting RESET during refueling/defueling will cause the operation to stop and ABORT will be displayed in the PRESEL window. The PRESEL value will then display the current total fuel quantity. To restart refueling/defueling, the PRESEL value will have to be incremented or decremented using the INCR/DECR switch</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>
		<clp-text-blue>PRESELECTED FUEL QUANTITY INCR/DECR SWITCH</clp-text-blue> (three position, spring loaded to center)
	</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Desired amount of fuel for processing a refueling or defueling operation, as set by the INCR/DECR switch</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>INCR or DECR</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>the current PRESEL display value on the RDI will increment/decrement by 10 lbs or 10 kg</li>
	<li>this is repeated 10 times after which the current PRESEL display will increment/decrement by 100 lbs or 100 kg</li>
	<li>indicates from 0 to 13780 lbs or 5800 kg</li>
	<li>the displayed preselect value will never <srtong>rise above the total fuel quantity</srtong> when the refuel mode status indicates a defuel operation is in progress</li>
	<li>the displayed preselect value will never <srtong>fall below the total fuel quantity</srtong> when the refuel mode status indicates a refuel operation is in progress</li>
	<li>four seconds after the INCR/DECR switch is stable at the neutral position, the auto-matic refuel/defuel function will start</li>
	<li>if refueling/defueling is in process and the INCR/DECR switch is moved out of its neutral position, the refuel/defuel operation will stop and will restart four seconds after the INCR/DECR switch activity is stopped</li>
