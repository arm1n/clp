<p><strong>Refuel/Defuel Control Panel</strong></p>


<p>The refuel/defuel control panel controls the pressure refueling and defueling operations and is located in the right engine nacelle. The rotary selector switch is used to set either the preselect or manual mode for refueling or defueling. The PRESELECT REFUEL or PRESELECT DEFUEL position causes the Fuel Quantity Computer (FQC) to automatically stop the refuel/defuel operation when the preselected levels are reached.</p>

<p>The REFUEL or DEFUEL position causes refueling or defueling to continue until the select switch is set to the OFF position. The high level sensors will always stop refueling to the related tank when a full tank is sensed.</p>
