<p><strong>Auxiliary Pump</strong></p>


<p>The auxiliary pump serves as a backup source for fuel supply to the engine if the primary ejector pump does not supply the minimum required fuel pressure for engine operation. The auxiliary pumps are used for takeoff, landing and during operation with low fuel levels.</p>

<p>The auxiliary pump is installed on the wing lower skin inside the collector bay of each main tank, adjacent to the primary ejector pump.
It is a submerged, electrically operated, centrifugal pump connected in parallel with the primary ejector pump. Each auxiliary fuel pump is powered by its related 115 Vac power.</p>


<p>The canister type pumps are accessible from the bottom surface of the wing, and permit <clp-text-red><b></b>removal of the pumping element without entering or draining the tank.</clp-text-red>There are two outlet ports, one for engine feed and one for fuel transfer. There is a flapper check valve in each outlet port.</p>

<p>The auxiliary pumps start automatically for <clp-text-blue><b>uel transfer and for defueling</b></clp-text-blue>f (if an AC ground power source is available). After the pump starts, the related ENG FUEL PRESS caution light goes out.</p>
