<p><strong>Level Control Shut-off Valve</strong></p>


<p>The level control shut-off valve lets fuel flow during transfer and refuel operations. It also acts as the primary shut-off device for fuel flow into the tank.</p>

<p>There is one level control shut-off valve in each wing. The valve is located in the refuel/transfer line and is hydro-mechanically controlled by the level control solenoid.<br>
The level control shut-off valve has a pilot port which is connected by a pilot line to the level control solenoid. The solenoid is normally closed which maintains refuel pressure in the piston chamber of the shut-off valve. This refuel pressure keeps the spring-loaded piston in the closed position.</p>


<p>When the level control solenoid opens, the fuel pressure is bled out through the pilot port of the shut-off valve. This allows refueling pres- sure to force the spring-loaded piston back and open the valve.</p>
