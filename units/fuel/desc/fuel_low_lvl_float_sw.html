<p><strong>Low Level Float Switch</strong></p>

<clp-img src="./units/fuel/desc/pic/cl_tank_fuel_low.svg" width="200"></clp-img>

<p>The low level float switches (one in each tank) operate the #1 TANK FUEL LOW and #2 TANK 
FUEL LOW caution lights on the Caution and Warning Panel. The low level float switch sends a signal to the caution and warning panel to indicate a <b>low fuel level in the collector bay.</b></p>

<p>The switch will be activated when the fuel tank quantity drops to approximately 305 lbs. At 
this point the appropriate FUEL TANK LOW caution light on the caution and warning panel 
in the flight compartment will come on.</p>
