<p><strong>Refuel/Defuel Adapter</strong></p>

<p>The refuel/defuel adapter gives single point pressure refuel/defuel 
access for the aircraft.</p>

<p>The refuel/defuel adapter is installed in the <clp-text-blue><b>right engine nacelle</b></clp-text-blue> behind the access door of the refuel/defuel panel.</p>

which closes after the fuel nozzle is removed. </p>
