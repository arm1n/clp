<p><strong>Vent Float Valves</strong></p>

<p>The vent float valve has a polyurethane foam float which closes the outboard vent line if the fuel level in the tank rises above the opening 
of the valve. This prevents fuel from flowing into the surge bay.</p>

<p>Two vent float valves (each wing) are located near the top of the rib dividing the main tank from the surge bay. The vent float valve located on the forward part of the rib supplies venting during a climb. The vent float valve located on the aft part of the rib supplies 
venting during a descent.</p>

<p>If the fuel flows to the outboard part of the main tank and submerges both vent valves, the inboard vent line will provide adequate venting. The two vent float valves and the inboard vent line provide adequate venting for most flight attitudes.</p>

<p>A high capacity refuel/dump vent valve provides outward relief when the main tank pressure reaches 4.0 psig.</p>
