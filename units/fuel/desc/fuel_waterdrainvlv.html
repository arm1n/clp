<p><strong>WATER DRAIN VALVE</strong></p>

<p>The water drain valves may be opened to drain any water accumulation in the tank. 
The valves are also used to drain residual fuel from the tanks when necessary.
</p>

<p>There are six water drain valves installed on the aircraft, three in each wing. 
They are located at the lowest points of the surge bay, main tank and collector bay. The drain valve is spring-loaded closed and may be locked in the open position. </p>

<clp-info-blue><b>NOTE:</b><br>The secondary seal design allows the replacement of the primary sealing 'O' ring with the fuel still in the tank. </clp-info-blue>
