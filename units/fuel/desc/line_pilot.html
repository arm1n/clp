<p><strong>PILOT LINE</strong></p>

<p>The pilot line is routed to each refuel/vent valve and used to keep the valve open while 
pressure refuelling is in progress.</p>

<p>Pressure is supplied by the tank vehicles through the single point refuel/defuel adapter
located in the right hand engine nacelle.</p>
