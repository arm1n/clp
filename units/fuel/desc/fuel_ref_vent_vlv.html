<p><strong>Vent Float Valves</strong></p>

<p><b>Refuel Vent Valve</b></p>
<p>The refuel vent valve provides tank overpressurization protection in the event of a fuel level control shut-off valve (SOV) failure during pressure refueling. The valve is kept open by refueling pressure. If the tank overfills due to a malfunction of the pressure refueling shut-off system, the open valve dumps fuel into the surge bay. If the surge bay fills up, fuel will spill overboard through the NACA vents. The refuel vent/ dump valve also releases pressure from the tank if it is more than 3.0 Â±0.25 psi above atmospheric pressure. A microswitch switch on the refuel vent/dump valve senses the valve position and sends the information to the refuel/defuel control panel.</p>

<p>The DUMP VALVE OPEN (TANK 1 or TANK 2) indicator light on the refuel/defuel control panel comes on when the related refuelvent/dump valve opens. If the valve does not open during refueling, the refuel/defuel control panel will stop the pressure refueling by sending a signal to the level control solenoid to close the level control shut-off valve.</p>

<p><b>High Level Sensor </b></p>
<p>The high level sensor stops the refuel or fuel transfer operation when the tank has reached its maximum allowable capacity.
A high level sensor is attached to each refuel vent/dump valve at the outboard end of each wing tank. It is a dual thermistor bead type. One bead gives a reference temperature while the other senses the fuel level. The sensor interfaces with the High Level Control Unit (HLCU) located in the fuselage.</p>

<p>When submerged in fuel during a refuel or transfer operation, the sensor sends a signal to the HLCU which then de-energizes the level control solenoid. This action closes the level control shut-off valve and stops any further refueling or transferring of fuel. </p>
