<p><strong>Auxiliary Pump Pressure Switch</strong></p>


<p>The Auxiliary Pump Pressure Switch sends a signal to the FUEL CONTROL TRANSFER panel to 
indicate that auxiliary pump is operating.</p>

<p>There are two auxiliary pump pressure switches, one connected to each auxiliary pump. They 
are mounted on the wing rear spar. Each pressure switch closes when 4 psig (28 kPa) of fuel 
pressure is supplied.</p>


<p>When the auxiliary pump is producing sufficient pressure, the auxiliary pump pressure switch 
sends a signal which causes the TANK 1 or TANK 2 AUX PUMP indication on the MFD fuel page 
to turn green. If there is not sufficient fuel pressure, the MFD fuel page indication changes 
from green to white.</p>
