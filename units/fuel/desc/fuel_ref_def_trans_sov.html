<p><strong>Refuel/Defuel Transfer Shut-off Valve</strong></p>


<p>The fuel transfer shut-off valves open to allow refueling, defueling or fuel transfer. There is one fuel transfer shut-off valve in each wing.</p>

<p>It consists of two parts:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the valve body</li>
	<li>the actuator</li>
</ul>

<p>The actuator opens and closes the valve. The actuator is mounted on the dry bay side external to the fuel tank. The actuator has a lever that manually operates the valve and acts as a valve position indicator.
The valve itself is an open/close ball type valve located inside the fuel tank. The actuator can be replaced without removing the valve or draining the fuel tank.</p>


<p>In the transfer mode, the valve is controlled by the TRANSFER switch on the FUEL CONTROL TRANSFER panel. In the automatic preselect refuel or preselect defuel mode, the valve is controlled by the Fuel Quantity Computer (FQC). In the manual refuel or defuel mode, the fuel transfer shut-off valve is controlled by the related TANK 1 or TANK 2 switch on the Refuel/Defuel Panel.</p>


<p>If the high level sensor is submerged during fuel transfer, the High Level Control Unit  (HLCU) will close the level control shut-off valve which stops the fuel transfer process The HLCU will also send a signal to close the fuel transfer shut-off valve.This provides a redundant means of stopping fuel transfer in case either the TO TANK 1 or TO TANK 2 switches on the FUEL CONTROL TRANSFER panel are left in the ON position.</p>
