<p><strong>Level Control Solenoid</strong></p>


<p>The level control solenoid valve controls the opening and closing of the level control shut-off valve. There is one level control solenoid in each wing. It is mounted on the rear wing spar. A pilot line connects each level control solenoid to its related level control SOV. When the solenoid is closed, its related SOV is also closed. When the solenoid is energized open, its related SOV opens.</p>

<br>
<p>When the <clp-text-blue><b>manual REFUEL mode</b></clp-text-blue> is selected, the level control solenoid is controlled by:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the Refuel/Defuel Panel</li>
	<li>the vent/dump valve control circuit</li>
</ul>

<p>When the <clp-text-blue><b>automatic PRESELECT mode</b></clp-text-blue> is selected, the solenoid is controlled by:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the Fuel Quantity Computer (FQC) </li>
	<li>the vent/dump valve circuit</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>In the <b>fuel transfer mode</b>, the level control solenoid (for the receiving tank) is energized open by selecting the TRANSFER toggle switch to the TO TANK 1 or TO TANK 2 position. This action opens the related level control SOV and causes fuel transfer to proceed.
<clp-text-blue><b>The high level sensor can also control the level control solenoid.</b></clp-text-blue></p>


<p>When the <b>high level sensor</b> is submerged in fuel, it sends a signal to the High Level Control Unit (HLCU), which will de-energize the level control solenoid and close the related level control SOV .</p>
