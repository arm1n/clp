<p><strong>TANK FUEL LOW</strong></p>

<clp-img src="./units/fuel/desc/pic/cl_tank_fuel_low.svg" width="200" ></clp-img>

<p>The <clp-text-blue><b>low level float switches</b></clp-text-blue> (one in each tank) operate the <clp-text-orange><b>#1 TANK FUEL LOW</b></clp-text-orange> and <clp-text-orange><b>#2 TANK FUEL LOW</b></clp-text-orange> caution lights on the Caution and Warning Panel. </p>



<p>The caution light will come on when the fuel level in the related collector bay drops 
below the sensing level of the switch. Operation of the low fuel level sensing system 
is independent from the rest of the indicating system.</p>

<p>To avoid nuisance low fuel level indications, <clp-text-blue>the low fuel caution lights are electrically tied to the parking brakes and the related engine oil pressure switch.</clp-text-blue> Both caution lights will function only when the parking brakes are released.
On engine shutdown, the related low fuel level caution light will not be powered regardless of the level of fuel in the collector bay.</p>
