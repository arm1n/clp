<p><strong>Surge Bays</strong></p>


<p><clp-text-blue><b>Each fuel tank is vented through a surge bay</b></clp-text-blue> located in the outboard section of the main tank. Fixed vent lines and float vent valves between the fuel tanks and the surge bays provide adequate capacity for in flight venting. 
During <clp-text-blue><b>pressure refueling, tank venting is supplemented by a high capacity vent valve</b></clp-text-blue> which is opened by refuel pressure.</p>
