<p><strong>Scavenge Ejectors</strong></p>

<p>The purpose of the scavenge ejectors is to keep the collector bay full of fuel and to reduce the quantity of unusable fuel. They continuously scavenge fuel from the main tank and transfer it to the collector bay.
The ejector has no moving parts and its operation is based on the venturi principle.</p>

<p>Pressurized fuel from the engine FMU is routed to the motive flow port of the ejector. The flow discharges at a high velocity from the nozzle into the throat section of the ejector. This creates a local low pressure area which draws fuel from the main tank into the suction port. This fuel is mixed with the motive flow fuel and is discharged at the outlet port. </p>

<p>The following is common to all ejectors used in this system:</p>

<ul>
	<li> Motive flow fuel is pumped to the ejector through the motive flow lines</li>
	<li>The low volume, high pressure motive flow causes the ejector to discharge a high volume, low pressure flow into the scavenge lines</li>
	<li>A 250 micron filter at the motive fuel flow inlet of the ejector</li>
</ul>
