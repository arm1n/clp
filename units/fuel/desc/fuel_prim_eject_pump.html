<p><strong>Primary Ejector Pump</strong></p>


<p>The primary ejector pump makes sure that there is positive pressure to the engine-driven pump to prevent the possibility of pump cavitation.</p>

<p>There is one primary ejector pump located in each collector bay. The primary ejector pump delivery rate is always greater than the engine-driven pump demand. The primary ejector pump operates on the venturi principle and has no moving parts. The high pressure motive fuel from the Fuel Metering Unit (FMU) is fed directly into the throat of the ejector.<br>
This creates a local low pressure area which draws fuel from the collector bay into the suction port. 
This fuel is mixed with the motive flow fuel and discharged through a flapper check valve. 
The flapper check valve has a 0.031 inch diameter hole in it to allow for thermal relief after engine shut down.</p>

<p><b>Inlet Strainer</b></p>
<p>The inlet strainers help prevent foreign objects from entering the fuel flow.
There are two inlet strainers, one for each primary ejector pump. 
Each inlet strainer is installed around the fuel inlet port of its related primary ejector pump.</p>
