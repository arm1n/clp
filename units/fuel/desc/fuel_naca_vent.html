<p><strong>Inlet NACA Vents</strong></p>


<p>The NACA vents are ice-free ram air vents which keep a slight positive pressure in the fuel tank while in flight. </p>

<p>The surge bay is vented overboard through dual NACA vents. 
The vents are located on the lower front edge of each wing.</p>


<p>The NACA vents are connected to standpipes which extend up to the top rear of the surge bay. 
These standpipes prevent any fuel which may accumulate in the bottom of the surge bay from spilling overboard.</p>
