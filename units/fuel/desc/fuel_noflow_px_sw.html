<p><strong>No-Flow Pressure Switch</strong></p>

<p>The no-flow pressure switch sends a signal to the refuel/defuel control panel to indicate that 
the refueling process has stopped.</p>

<p>There are two no-flow pressure switches in the refuel/defuel system. The switches are 
installed downstream of each level control shut-off valve (SOV).</p>

<p>The no-flow switches sense the pressure in the fuel lines. When the level control SOV closes, 
the pressure in the line decreases and the switch closes.</p>


<p>This completes an electrical circuit and causes the white TANK 1 or TANK 2 REFUEL SHUTOFF 
indicator on the refuel/defuel control panel to come on. This indicates that the related level 
control SOV is closed and refueling (of that fuel tank) is no longer possible.</p>
