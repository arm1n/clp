<p><strong>Vent Line</strong></p>

<p><strong>Inboard Vent Line</strong></p>
<p>The inboard vent line supplies <b>venting</b> when the fuel is moving outboard or inboard in the tank, as in a <clp-text-blue><b>climb, uncoordinated flight maneouvers, accelerated rolls, refueling and defueling.</b></clp-text-blue> The inboard vent line runs immediately below the wing top skin from the surge bay along the forward wing spar to the inboard part of the main fuel tank. </p>

<p>The line is completely unobstructed in order to supply continuous venting protection for the wing tank.Due to the slight pressurization of the surge bay excess fuel in the bottom of the bay is scavenged back into the main tank.
</p>

<p><strong>Outboard Vent Line</strong></p>
<p>The outboard vent lines vent the main fuel tanks to the surge bays (refer to Vent Float Valves). There are two outboard vent lines in each fuel tank connecting the main fuel tank to the surge bay. Each vent line is connected to a vent float valve. The vent lines extend down to the bottom of the surge bay. As the surge bay is pressurized in flight, through the NACA vents, any fuel in the surge bay is scavenged by 
the outboard vent lines back into the main tank.</p>
