<p><strong>Fuel Quantity Probes</strong></p>

<p>The fuel quantity probes sense the fuel level in the tanks and transmit the information 
to the Fuel Quantity Computer (FQC).</p>

<p>There are 18 fuel quantity probes, nine in each wing. The probes contain two concentric 
metal cylinders, a terminal block, and two mounting brackets. </p>

<p>The cylinders form the capacitor elements (plates); the inner plate is the high-impedance 
element and the outer plate is the low-impedance element.</p>


<p>Changes in fuel levels around each probe cause corresponding changes in the effective 
capacitance of each probe, a change in capacitance shows as a change in fuel quantity 
on the MFD. 
The probes are monitored by the FQC.</p>
