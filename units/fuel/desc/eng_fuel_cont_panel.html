<p><strong>Fuel Control Transfer Panel </strong></p>

<p>The FUEL CONTROL TRANSFER panel has a TRANSFER switch and two switchlights. The three-position toggle TRANSFER switch is used to set the direction of fuel transfer (TO TANK 1 or TO TANK 2).</p>

<p>When the TRANSFER switch is selected to the TANK 1 or TANK 2 position:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the auxiliary pump (in the collector bay of the donortank) comes on automatically</li>
	<li>the fuel transfer shut-off valves open</li>
	<li>the level control shut-off valve in the receiving tank opens</li>
</ul>

<p>A signal from the operating auxiliary pump pressure switch causes the related ON 
switchlight segment to turn green.</p>

<p>Fuel transfer indications are shown on the fuel page of the Multi Function Display (MFD).</p>
