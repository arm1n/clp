<p><strong>Refuel/Defuel Shut-off Valve Actuator</strong></p>

<p>The refuel/defuel shut-off valve actuator opens and closes the refuel/defuel shut-off valve and is attached to the refuel/defuel shut-off valve by a splined shaft.
The actuator is installed on the dry side of the rear wing spar. The actuator has a physical and electrical position indication and may be replaced without draining fuel from the tank.</p>

<p>The actuator has a lever that operates the valve and gives a position indication. The actuator is controlled by the rotary selector switch on the refuel/defuel control panel. The switch opens the valve and causes the MASTER VALVE CLOSED indicator light to go off when any refuel/defuel mode is selected.</p>

<p><b>Refuel/Defuel Shut-off Valve</b></p>


<p>The refuel/defuel shut−off valve is installed in the refuel/defuel/transfer manifold, and is opened when refueling or defueling.
The valve is located on the right side aft wing spar. The valve is closed in flight to isolate the refuel adapter from the rest of the fuel system.</p>

<p>The refuel/defuel shut−off valve is operated by an electrically driven actuator. A thermal relief valve is installed in the valve to prevent excessive pressure buildup in the fuel system lines.</p>
