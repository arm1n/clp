<p><strong>Refuel/Defuel Control Panel</strong></p>

<p>The refuel/defuel control panel controls the pressure refueling and defueling operations and is located in the right engine nacelle. 
The rotary selector switch is used to set either the preselect or manual mode for refueling or defueling. The PRESELECT REFUEL or PRESELECT DEFUEL position causes the Fuel Quantity Computer (FQC) to automatically stop the refuel/defuel operation when the preselected levels are reached.</p>

<p>The REFUEL or DEFUEL position causes refueling or defueling to continue until the select switch is set to the OFF position.
The high level sensors will always stop refueling to the related tank when a full tank is sensed.</p>

<p>The TANK 1 and TANK 2 PRECHECK/OPEN/CLOSE toggle switches are located on the bottom right corner of the Refuel/Defuel Control Panel.</p>


<p>The Refuel/Defuel Indicator (RDI) is located on the refuel/defuel control panel.</p>

<p>The indicator shows the:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Quantity of fuel in each wing tank</li>
	<li>Quantity of fuel selected in the automatic mode for refueling/defueing</li>
	<li>Total quantity of fuel in both tanks</li>
</ul>
