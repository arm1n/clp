<p><strong>Low Fuel Pressure Switch</strong></p>

<p>The purpose of the low fuel pressure switch is to indicate low fuel pressure at the outlet of the fuel pump.The low fuel pressure switch is installed on the Fuel Metering Unit (FMU).</p>

<p>The Low Fuel Pressure Switch is a dual channel electrical switch. When fuel pressure applied on the pressure plate is above a preset value, the electrical switch contacts are held open. When the fuel pressure drops below the preset value, the electrical switch contacts relax to a closed state .This sends a signal to the FADEC, then to the ECIU and flight compartment for indication.</p>

<p><clp-text-blue> pressure switch is located at the inlet of the engine boost stage pump.</clp-text-blue>A 
If the fuel pressure from the primary ejector and/or auxiliary pump drops 
below 5.5 psi (38 kPa), the switch will provide a #1 ENG FUEL PRESS or 
#2 ENG FUEL PRESS low pressure caution light to the flight compartment.</p>
