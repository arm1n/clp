<p><strong>Magnetic Dipstick</strong></p>

<p>The magnetic dipsticks give an alternate means to measure the fuel quantity when 
the aircraft is on the ground. One magnetic dipstick is installed in each main tank, outboard of the engines.</p>

<p></p>

<p>A magnetic dipstick is a calibrated rod with a magnet attached. It moves within a 
tube that extends vertically from the bottom of the fuel tank. A float moves up and 
down on the outside surface of this tube to match the fuel level in the tank. The 
float contains a magnet that attracts the magnet on the magnetic dipstick.</p>

<clp-info-blue><p>The magnetic dipstick is accessed at the bottom of the wing. When the rod is 
released, it moves slowly down until the rod magnet is attracted by the float 
magnet. The fuel quantity is shown in US gallons or in litres.</p></clp-info-blue>
