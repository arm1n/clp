<p><strong>Temperature Sensor</strong></p>

<p>The temperature sensor senses the fuel temperature in the left tank and transmits the information for display in the flight compartment.</p>

<p>The tank temperature sensor is located on the No.1 tank collector bay wall. The sensor uses electrical resistance to monitor the fuel temperature. </p>


<p>The analog output is sent to the HLCU for signal conditioning, and then to the EIS for display. The system is operational when electrical power is supplied to the aircraft. The temperature is shown on the MFD Fuel Page and ranges from -70 to +75 C (-94 to 167 F).</p>
