<p><strong>Engine Feed Shut-off Valve</strong></p>

<p>The engine feed shut-off valve is used to stop the fuel supply to the engine in the event of a fire.
The valve is installed inside the tank on the rear spar. The valve has an electrically driven actuator which operates an open-closed ball valve positioned in the engine fuel feed line.The actuator is installed on the dry side of the spar and splined to the valve. The actuator has physical and electrical position indication and may be replaced without changing the valve or draining the fuel tank.</p>

<p>There are two thermal relief valves: one at the inlet and one at the outlet of the shutoff valve. They are set to open between 65 and 70 psig to protect the system from over pressurization when the valve is closed. The engine feed shut-off valve is controlled and operated by the PULL FUEL/HYD OFF handle located in the flight compartment, on the engine fire protection panel.</p>

<p>The green light comes on to show that the valve is open. The white light comes on to show that 
the valve is closed.
The battery bus supplies the electrical power to the engine feed shut-off valve.</p>
