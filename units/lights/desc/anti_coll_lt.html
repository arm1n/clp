<p><strong>Anti-Collision Lights</strong></p>


<p>Two white anti−collision lights, that are located on the fuselage, flash to make the aircraft more visible on the ground and in flight. When the aircraft is on the ground, a red recognition light is turned on to show that the engines are about to start and are operating.</p>

<p>When the anti collision lights switch is set to the RED or WHITE position, the normal "on ground" power removal circuits are bypassed. The anti collision lights switch is located in the flight compartment on the overhead panel. If the SSFDR BITE indicates satisfactory system operation, the caution panel FLT DATA RECORDER light goes out.</p>

<p>The white anti−collision lights have two elements. A secondary element selection is made using a toggle switch located in the aft fuselage equipment bay in the event of a malfunction of the other element. It allows selection of the secondary element for the upper anti−collision light, lower anti−collision light, both anti-collision lights, or OFF (for normal use). Control stays the same when the secondary element is selected.</p>
