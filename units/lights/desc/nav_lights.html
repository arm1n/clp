<p><strong>NAVIGATION LIGHTS</strong></p>


<p>The navigation lights are standard dual red and green wing position lights, with a single white tail position light. Optional dual white tail position lights are available. </p>

<p>The two wingtip position lights have primary and secondary bulbs that automatically switch in the event of a failure. Two discrete electronic current sensing switches, installed to the outboard forward wing spars, supplies current sensing to the lights and switch the ground path to the secondary light when a failure is sensed.</p>

<p>The wing and tail position lights are controlled by the same switch, labeled OFFâˆ’POSN on the overhead EXTERIOR LIGHTS control panel. When the switch is selected to POSN, all position lights come on. After a time delay, the secondary light on each wing tip will go out if the primary light stays on. If the primary light on the wing tip fails, the secondary light will come on automatically.</p>
