<p><strong>CURRENT SENSING MODULE SWITCH</strong></p>

<p>The forward position lights have primary and secondary elements with an electronic switch. When the overhead switch is set to POSN, all of the position lights come on. After 0.7 seconds, the secondary elements, controlled through an electronic switch unit, go out and remain armed, ready to come on in the event of primary element failure.</p>

<p>The switch module senses the reduced current when there is a failure with the primary bulb. When a failure is sensed, the secondary bulb is automatically switched on by the switch module.</p>
