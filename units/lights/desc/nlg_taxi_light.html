<p><strong>NLG Taxi Light</strong></p>


<p>The Taxi Light is installed on the nose landing gear. It comes on when the nose landing gear is on the ground, and the Taxi Light switch is set to TAXI.</p>

<p>The taxi light is controlled by an overhead TAXI switch located in the flight compartment. The nose landing gear must be on the ground for the taxi light to come on. A signal is supplied from the Proximity Sensor Electronic Unit (PSEU) to complete the control circuit.</p>
