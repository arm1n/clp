<p><strong>Fuel Heater</strong></p>

<p>The purpose of the fuel heater is to heat the fuel to prevent the formation of ice crystals. The fuelheater assembly of a heater assembly and a filter assembly. <br>
An impending bypass switch reads the pressure drop across the whole unit and sends a signal to the Caution and Warning panel in the flight compartment when one of the filtration components needs to be replaced. 
</p>

<p>The switch indicates an impending bypass when the pressure differential is 18 to 21 psid (124.1 to 145 kPad).</p>



<p>The fuel heater incorporates an oil bypass valve on the oil side of the unit which is both pressure and temperature controlled. <br>The oil bypass valve is pressure sensitive and will bypass oil when the oil pressure reaches 28 ±3 psid.The oil bypass valve is also equipped with a thermal sensor on the fuel side. 
The thermal sensor keeps the valve fully opened when the fuel temperature is below 90 °F (32 °C). 
As the fuel temperature increases above 90 °F (32 °C), the thermal sensor starts closing the oil bypass valve. When the fuel temperature reaches 120 °F (49 °C), the valve is fully closed and the oil bypasses the heater. </p>
