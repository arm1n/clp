<p><strong>Drain Collector</strong></p>




<p>The engine drains are divided into a forward drain system and a rear drain system. The forward and the rear drains connect to the lower cowl drain lines and are routedseparately to an external drain mast.</p>

<p>The <strong>forward drain lines</strong> are routed individually to a <strong>collector tank</strong> except for the auxiliary feathering pump seal and the engine driven hydraulic pump seal. These two drain lines are joined upstream of the collector tank. The collector tank connects to a drain line in the lower cowl through a flexible hose with two Camloc fasteners. This attachment allows for a quick release during removal or lowering of the lower cowl to the maintenance position.</p>
