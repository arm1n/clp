<p><strong>AC Generator</strong></p>

<p>Two ac generators are installed, one on each engine, to supply power independently to the left and right ac bus systems.<br>
When one generator malfunctions, the ac variable frequencysystem automatically connects the two ac busses to the serviceablegenerator and disconnects the two galley buses.</p>

<p>Each ac generator usually supplies its own ac bus. When an acgenerator or ac GCU malfunctions, its related bus contactor, K1 or K2 will automatically move to connect its bus to the opposite generator and to cause galley contactors K5 and K6 to disconnect the two galley busses.</p>

<p>The two ac generators supply variable frequency, 340 to 560 Hz acpower through the two position bus contactors, K1 and K2 to their related 115 Vac variable frequency bus. The AC GCUs control the bus contactor operation. When the AC GCU senses an ac generator
malfunction, it will cause the bus contactor, K1or K2 to move to across-tie position to connect its bus to the other ac generator.</p>
