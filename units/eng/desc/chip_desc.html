<p><strong>Chip Detectors</strong></p>

<div>The chip detectors attract and detect ferrous particles (debris) in the oil system and send signals 
to FADEC.The chip detection system has three chip detectors to indicate the presence of ferrous 
chips coming from the:</div>

<ul>
	<li>AC generator</li>
	<li>Turbomachinery module</li>
	<li>Reduction Gearbox (RGB) module</li>
</ul>

<p>The chip detector signals are transmitted electrically (analogue) to the FADEC channel A and 
digitally to FADEC channel B.</p>

<p>The chip detectors are located in the scavenge oil stream of the oil system.
All the oil that goes back to the main tank passes across the poles of the chip detectors.</p>
