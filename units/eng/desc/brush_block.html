<p><strong>Bracket-Deicing Brush Block Assembly</strong></p>

<p>The brush block contains the spring loaded brushes that transfers de- icing power from the airframe to the rotating propeller using sliprings.</p>



<br>
<p><strong>Magnetic Pickup Unit (MPU)</strong></p>

<p>The purpose of the MPU is to signal PEC for the NP and phase of the propeller. The speed and phase of the propeller is sensed by a Magnetic Pickup Unit and a set of 7 targets on the deicing slipring. </p>

<p>Six targets give speed signalling/phase inputs and <clp-text-blue>one acts as a master reference for balancing purposes</clp-text-blue>. The MPU is a dual channel device located on the front of the reduction gearbox.</p>
