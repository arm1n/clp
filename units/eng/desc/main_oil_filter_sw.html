<p><strong>Oil Filter Impending Bypass Warning System</strong></p>


<p>The oil filter impending bypass warning system uses a bypass switch to warn of an impending bypass of oil across the oil filter. This indicates a contaminated oil filter. When the oil filter differential pressure is more than 22 psid (152 kPad), the pressure switch opens. This change of state is detected by the FADEC which then sends a discrete signal to the EMU.</p>

<p>The EMU makes a record of a main oil filter impending bypass event. </p>

<p><clp-text-blue>During operation with cold oil <clp-text-red>main oil temperature less than 175 F 80 C</clp-text-red>, any impending bypass signal is ignored by the FADEC. This will prevent false event messages from being stored in the EMU.</clp-text-blue></p>
