<p><strong>Indicated Turbine Temperature (ITT) Probe</strong></p>

<p>Eight probes consisting of three temperature sensing elements give 24 measurement points for comprehensive gas temperature measuring. The probes are equi-spaced, on right and left sides, with no probes at top or bottom around the circumference at station 6 of the engine (downstream of the 2nd Power Turbine). ITT measurement is done by 24 Chromel-Alumel thermocouples connected in parallel by the ITT wiring harness.The total signal is connected at a junction located at the rear of the engine. <br>The junction is connected to a wiring harness which goes to the Main Oil 
Temperature/Cold Junction sensor.Before being processed by the FADEC, the raw ITT is trimmed 
by a lug mounted resistor. </p>

<p>The trimmed ITT and Main Oil Temperature (MOT) are processed by the FADEC and output to the flight compartment over an ARINC 429 bus.The ITT information is also sent to the EMU. <br>The average signal (by virtue of parallel arrangement) is routed through the ITT Trim Resistor and the cold junction reference before being received and processed by the FADEC.The ITT Trim Resistor is used to provide compensation to the raw ITT signal. <br>The value of the resistor is set during engine pass off testing at the manufacturer or approved overhaul facility.</p>
