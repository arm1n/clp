<p><strong>High Pressure Rotor Speed (NH) Sensor</strong></p>


<p>The NH sensor gives high pressure compressor speed information to the FADEC and to the overspeed logic.</p>

<p>There are two NH sensors located on top of the Accessory Gearbox (AGB). Each NH sensor is a sealed unit and has two coils. The sensors pick up high pressure rotor speed signals from the fuel pump/PMA gearshaft teeth.</p>

<p>One coil provides a NH speed signal to the FADEC (for use in the control and indication logic). The other provides a NH speed signal for the overspeed logic. There are two sensors on each engine.</p>
