<p><strong>P2.7 Intercompressor Bleed-Off Valve</strong></p>


<p>The HBOVs bleed engine air from the main gas path to provide increased surge margin for engine handling during starting, steady state and transient operation. <br>
The engine has two shut off valves, one at the engine station 2.2, to bleed low pressure compressor inlet air and the other located at engine station 2.7, to bleed high pressure compressor inlet air.</p>

<p>Each FADEC channel commands an independent coil of a 
torque motor mounted inside the HBOVs. </p>
