<p><strong>Pitch Control Unit (PCU)</strong></p>


<p>The purpose of the PCU is to control the flow of oil pressure to the fine and coarse pitch sides 
of the propeller pitch change mechanism.</p>

<p>The PCU modulates high pressure oil supplied by the Over-Speed Governor (OSG) using a 
servovalve. The servovalve receives electrical signals from the PEC and directs oil pressure 
through a transfer sleeve and beta tubes, to the coarse/fine sides of the propeller pitch change 
piston.</p>

<div>The PCU has these components:</div>
<ul>
	<li>Servovalve</li>
	<li>Unfeather valve</li>
	<li>Beta Feedback Transducer</li>
	<li>Ground Beta Enable Solenoid Valve</li>
	<li>Back up Feather Valve</li>
	
</ul>

<p>The PCU rear case gives the interface with the beta feedback transducer (BFT).</p>

<p><clp-text-blue>The Ground Beta Enable Solenoid Valve (GBEV), the Unfeather Solenoid Valve, the servovalve, and the Beta Feedback Transducer (BFT), are line replaceable units.</clp-text-blue></p>

<p>The PCU is located on the rear face of the reduction gearbox and is attached to a bolted on adaptor on the gearbox by a V-band clamp.</p>
