<p><strong>DC Starter/Generator</strong></p>

<p>The two DC generators supply 28 Vdc electrical power through the bus contactors, K1 and K2 to their related left or right main feederbus. When the DC GCU senses a DC starter/generator malfunction, it will cause the bus contactor, K1 or K2 to open circuit the DCstarter/generator source.</p>

<p>The DC starter/generator operation is controlled and monitored by the DC Generator Control Unit (GCU). 
and controls the operation of its bus contactor K1 or K2.
</p>

<p>When the Electrical Power Control Unit (EPCU) senses a DC starter/generator malfunction, it will cause the main feeder bus tie contactor, K21 to move to a cross-tie position toconnect its main feeder bus to the other DC starter/generator.</p>

<p>The DC starter/generator has a <clp-text-blue>temperature switch</clp-text-blue> that closes a set of contacts when the 
temperature of the DC starter/generator is excessive. It gives continuity through two pins on 
the DC starter/generator connector to make the <clp-text-orange><b>DC GEN HOT</b></clp-text-orange> indication come on in the caution 
and warning lighting panel.</p>
