<p><strong>T1.8 Temperature Sensor</strong></p>


<p>A dual platinum resistance temperature device located in the intake just upstream of the first stage low pressure compressor. The sensor is used to measure air intake temperature. That temperature is used to calculate engine ratings. Calculated engine ratings are used to automatically set maximum rated power and display maximum rated torque in the flight deck.</p>

<p>Intake temperature measured by the T1.8 sensor is used by the local FADEC and transmitted to the opposite FADEC. The two values are averaged in each FADEC to ensure that Rated Torque displayed in the flight compartment, on the Engine Display (ED), is the same for both engines. </p>

<p>T1.8 is the primary source of intake temperature to the FADEC. The maximum allowable difference between local and opposite T1.8 is ±2 °C. The secondary source of intake air temperature is provided by the Air Data Unit (ADU).</p>

<p>The FADEC also monitors the ADU Static Air Temperature (SAT) from both channels. The SAT from the ADU could be used as primary source depending on the rating selected.</p>
