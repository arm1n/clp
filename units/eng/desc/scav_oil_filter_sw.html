<p><strong>Oil Filter Impending Bypass Warning System</strong></p>


<p>The oil filter impending bypass warning system uses a bypass switch to warn of an impending bypass of oil across the oil filter. This indicates a contaminated oil filter. </p>

<p>When the oil filter differential pressure is more than 22 psid (152 kPad), the pressure switch opens. This change 
of state is detected by the FADEC which then sends a discrete signal to the EMU.</p>
