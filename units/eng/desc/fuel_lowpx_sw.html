<p><strong>Low Fuel Pressure Switch</strong></p>

<p>The low fuel pressure switch and the fuel filter impending bypass switch each sends independent signals to the two FADEC channels. The signals are then sent to the ECIU and from there to the flight compartment for indication.The low fuel pressure switch is adjusted to operate on increasing pressure at 8 psig (55.2 kPag).On decreasing pressure, the switch is adjusted to operate at 5.5 ±0.8 psig (38 ±5.5 kPag).
</p>

<p>The fuel filter impending bypass switch is adjusted to operate on in- creasing pressure at 19 ±2 psid (131 ±14 kPad).On decreasing pressure, the switch is adjusted to operate by 13 psid (90 kPad). The low fuel pressure switch senses low fuel pressure at the outlet of the fuel pump.</p>

<div>The low fuel pressure switch is installed on the Fuel Metering Unit (FMU).
The switch has:</div>

<ul>
	<li>A pressure port </li>
	<li>A switch and piston assembly</li>
	<li>A receptacle and body assembly</li>
	<li>Four filtered vents</li>
	<li>A spring</li>
</ul>

<p>The Low Fuel Pressure Switch consists of a pressure plate and a dual channel electrical switch.
When fuel pressure (on the pressure plate) is above a preset value, the electrical switch c
ontacts are held open (resistance >10 k).</p>
