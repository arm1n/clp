<p><strong>Propeller Electronic Control Unit (PEC)</strong></p>


<p>The purpose of the PEC is to control propeller pitch by controlling the servovalve. The Propeller 
Electronic Control (PEC) is a dual lane control device, that supplies the servovalve drive current, 
to drive two motor coils in the servovalve.</p>

<p>A number of failure conditions will cause the propeller to go into coarse pitch automatically.
The coarse pitch bias was chosen because, total loss of electrical power will cause fuel supply 
to the engine to be shut off, so it is appropriate in this condition to feather the propeller.</p>

<div>The failure conditions are:</div>
<ul>
	<li>Total loss of electrical power</li>
	<li>Loss of output from both PEC control lanes </li>
	<li>Failure of both servovalve torque motor coils</li>
	
</ul>

<p>The PEC is installed in the forward nacelle of each engine, on the spine between the forward and mid frames. Anti-vibration mounts are used at all mounting points, and all connectors point vertically downwards.<br> The Propeller Electronic Controller (PEC) controls the various modes of the propeller system.</p>

<div>The modes are:</div>
<ul>
	<li>Speed control </li>
	<li>Reverse thrust speed control </li>
	<li>Engine uptrim command</li>
	<li>Beta control </li>
	<li>Autofeather</li>
	<li>Synchrophasing </li>
	<li>AUPC</li>
	
</ul>
