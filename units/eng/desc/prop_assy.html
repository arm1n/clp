<div>The aircraft is equipped with two propeller systems, one for each engine. Each system has:</div>
<ul>
	<li>Dowty CR 408/6-123 - F/17 propeller assembly</li>
	<li>Pitch Control Unit (PCU)</li>
	<li>Auxiliary Feather pump</li>
	<li>Propeller Electronic Control (PEC)</li>
	<li>Overspeed Governor (OSG) and pump</li>
</ul>



<p>The propeller blades are of variable pitch, and are <clp-text-blue>counter weighted</clp-text-blue> to move towards coarse pitch in the event of oil pressure failure. Pitch change is accomplished by metered oil pressure. The oil pressure originates from the related engine and is supplied to a pump which is part of the Overspeed Governor (OSG) installation.</p>

<p>The propeller system has a double acting pitch change mechanism that uses high pressure oil to control blade pitch.</p>

<div>The propeller control system operates the propeller in these modes and functions:</div>
<ul>
	<li>Constant speed mode</li>
	<li>Synchrophase mode</li>
	<li>Beta mode</li>
	<li>Feather function</li>
</ul>
