<p><strong>Oil Pressure and Scavenge Pump Assemblies</strong></p>

<p>The oil pressure and scavenge pump assembly pressurizes and scavenges the oil in the engine oil system. The scavenge pumps also optimize bearing cavity sealing during a subidle condition.</p>


<p>The pump assembly consists of 9 vane type pump stages and a cold- start valve. These vane pumps are contained in a pump pack and are located on the right side of the engine. This pump pack is serviced as one line replaceable unit. <br>The cold-start valve is a spring loaded poppet valve.The cold start valve operates when very cold oil causes the oil pressure to be too high. <br>The valve operates at a pressure of 300 to 360 psid (2068 to 2482 kPad) and bypasses oil back to the 
oil tank.</p>



<br>

<div>The Oil system has these three sub-systems:</div>
<ul>
	<li>Pressure system that supplies oil to the reduction gearbox and the turbomachinery</li>
	<li>Scavenge system that returns the used oil to the tank</li>
	<li>Vent and breather system that vents the bearing cavities and removes any air trapped in the scavenged oil</li>
</ul>
