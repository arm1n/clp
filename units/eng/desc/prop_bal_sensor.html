<p><strong>Vibration Transduce</strong></p>

<p>The Vibration Transducer is a small piezo electric sensor with interface circuitry contained in a sealed metal case. It is attached with a bracket to the engine gearbox.<br>
Electrical power to the Vibration Transducer is supplied as a dc bias from the Active Noise Control Unit (ANCU) J7 connector. The Vibration Transducer output signals to the ANCU align with the dc bias supply.

<p><strong>PBMS Terminal</strong></p>
<div>The PBMS Terminal consists of Ultra Electronics proprietary software running on a PC. The basic 
functions provided are:</div>
<ul>
	<li>Reading data from the Controller and storing the data on the Terminal's hard drive</li>
	<li>Displaying the initial moment and vibration levels</li>
	<li>Calculate the balance weight installation required to minimize propeller vibration and show the consequent moment and vibration levels</li>
	<li>Print the initial and final moment and vibration data</li>
</ul>
