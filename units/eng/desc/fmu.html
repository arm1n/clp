<p><strong>Fuel Metering Unit (FMU)</strong></p>

<p>The FMU modulates the engine fuel flow over the entire operational envelope of the 
engine in response to signals sent by the FADEC.</p>

<p>The FMU is installed on the Permanent Magnet Alternator (PMA) on the LP compressor case. It is attached to the PMA with a V−band clamp. It has a fuel inlet port connected to the airframe fuel supply and a fuel outlet port connected to the fuel flowmeter. It also has fuel heater inlet and outlet ports. The FMU has electrical connections for the engine and airframe harnesses.</p>



<p>The FMU has two integral fuel pumps. A low pressure pump and a high pressure pump. Both pumps are engine−driven.<br>
Fuel from the low pressure pump is routed to the fuel heater. From the fuel heater, fuel is then routed to the inlet of the high pressure pump. From there, it enters the metering portion of the FMU.</p>
