<p><strong>Full Authority Digital Electronic Control (FADEC)</strong></p>

<p>The FADEC is a dual-channel microprocessor-based controller. Each channel has identical hardware and 
software. The hardware in each channel incorporates a central processor, an Input/Output (I/O) gate 
array, appropriate I/O interfaces and a fully independent overspeed system. Hardware discretes, utilized 
for channel control, and a cross talk serial bus are the only links between channels.<br>The independent 
overspeed protection system uses redundant NH signals from the engine to command a fuel shut off in 
the event of an NH overspeed. The overspeed trip is set at 108% NH. The overspeed circuitry is tested 
each time the engine is shut down.</p>

<div>The FADEC calculates the maximum rated power available for each 
rating from the inputs that follow:</div>

<ul>
	<li>Ambient temperature and air pressure data from the ADU</li>
	<li>Air temperature from the T1.8 sensor</li>
	<li>Ambient pressure data from a FADEC mounted sensor</li>
	<li>Selected bleed mode</li>
	<li>Selected rating</li>
</ul>

<p>From these inputs and in conjunction with the propeller speed, the FADEC displays the torque target on 
the Engine Display (ED). The FADEC then increases or decreases the fuel flow through the FMU to match 
the indicated torque to the target torque,if the PLA is in the Rated Power detent.</p>
