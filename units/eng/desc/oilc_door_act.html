<p><strong>Oil Cooler Air Outlet Flap Actuator</strong></p>

<p>The oil cooler air outlet flap actuator is to position the outlet flap to the position commanded 
by FADEC. The oil cooler air outlet flap actuator is attached to the nacelle structure and the oil 
cooler air outlet flap.</p>

<p>It receives signals from the Full Authority Digital Engine Computer (FADEC), through the Engine Control Interface Unit (ECIU). The signals give instruction to fully open or close the oil cooler air outlet flap (with two open positions between, if necessary).</p>

<div>Test the operation of the oil cooler flap door and ejector solenoid using this procedure:</div>
	
<ul>
	<li><b>PLA</b> Flight Idle</li>
	<li><b>CLA</b> Fuel Off </li>
	<li>Maintenance Mode Discrete On</li>
	<li>Select <b>RDC TOP Reset</b>. (Simulates oil temperature of 107 C)</li>
	<li>The outlet flap moves smoothly to the fully open position</li>
	<br>
	<li>Press <b>RDC TOP DEC</b> (Each time the button is pressed simulates a fall in MOT of 2째C.)</li>
	<li>Make sure that the air outlet flap (2) closes in increments as the oil temperature decreases through 93째C, 89째C, and 85째C.</li>
