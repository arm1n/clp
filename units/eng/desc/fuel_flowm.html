<p><strong>Fuel Flowmeter</strong></p>

<p>The two fuel tubes route fuel from the Fuel Metering Unit (FMU) to the fuel nozzle adapters. One goes from the FMU to the Fuel Flowmeter. The other goes from the flowmeter to the Flow Divider Valve (FDV).
</p>

<p>The flowmeter detects fuel flow and sends this information to the flight compartment for 
display on the ED.</p>
