<p><strong>Torque Sensor (TQ)</strong></p>


<p>The torque sensors send torque and power turbine speed information to the FADEC.</p>

<p>There are two torque sensors located on the air inlet case.The two torque sensors take their 
signal from torque shafts in the reduction gearbox.<br>
Correction of torque shaft stiffness caused by temperature change is done by the FADEC and PEC.</p>

<p>The Main Oil Temperature (MOT) probe (on top of the front inlet case) sends the temperature information for this computation.</p>

<p>Each sensor has two coils which are used to sense Torque (Q) and Power Turbine Speed (NPT). Each sensor supplies a Torque and NPT speed signal to the FADEC, the ED and PEC using one coil for each.</p>
