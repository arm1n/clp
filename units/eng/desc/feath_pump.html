<p><strong>Feathering Pump</strong></p>

<p>The purpose of the feathering pump is to feather the propeller independently of the normal control system and achieves full feather (zero windmilling).</p>


<p>The pump supplies backup oil pressure if the engine supply is not available. It gets its oil supply independently from a reserved chamber in the reduction gearbox. When energized, the pump supplies oil pressure to the PCU, which will feather the propeller blades.</p>
<br>
<div>The pump is energized during:</div>
<ul>
	<li>Autofeather</li>
	<li>Alternate feather</li>
	<li>Maintenance feather/unfeather</li>
	
</ul>



<p>The unit has a gear pump and 28 Vdc electric motor. The electric drive to the pump has a run time (30 sec.) protection relay to prevent damage to the unit.</p>
