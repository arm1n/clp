<p><strong>HTC System</strong></p>

<p>The HTCS gives the EVIS high torsional stiffness for engine torque loads. It also gives low translational stiffness to minimize the transmission of vibrations to the engine mount system. Under a counter-clockwise positive torque load, the actuators compress the hydraulic fluid into the reservoir through an orifice. Fluid pressure against a piston in the reservoir is opposed by a spring.</p>

<p>The system is pre-pressurized against the reaction of the spring loaded piston in the reservoir, plus some reaction from the mounts, to 211 psig (1455 kPag). This is to avoid the possibility of cavitation during a rapid transition to negative torque. The pressure can be determined by measuring the stand-out of the indicator at the end of the reservoir.</p>

<p>In the event that fire causes leakage of the hydraulic fluid, the front mounts will snub and react to the engine torque.</p>
