<p><strong>Oil Temperature Sensor (MOT)</strong></p>


<p>The oil temperature sensor is located on the top of the air inlet case. It is installed in an oil wetted cavity and is held in place with two bolts and sealed with a preformed packing. The P16 wiring harness connector is connected to a receptacle mounted on the sensor. This connector transmits the sensor signals to the FADEC through the wiring harness. A ground strap connects the housing of the sensor to the air inlet case.</p>

<p>The sensor has a housing, and four conductors of different material, two Chromel and two Alumel, that are joined at one end (bimetal junction). This gives the sensor <clp-text-blue>two channels to provide for a backup if one channel fails.</clp-text-blue></p>

<p>The other ends of the four Chromel and Alumel conductors, are connected to the receptacle and to a flexible cable that goes out of the sensor. The other end of the cable connects to the ITT thermocouple wiring harness with four terminals that have an antirotation property. On the outside of the sensor are two mounting studs. These studs hold the ITT Trim Resistor </p>

<p><clp-text-blue>The FADEC uses the resistor to trim the ITT signal to compensate for engine to engine 
differences in measured ITT and to keep all engines within a small ITT window.</clp-text-blue>

<p>The sensor is a welded assembly and cannot be disassembled in the field.</p>
