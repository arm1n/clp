<p><strong>Low Pressure Rotor Speed Sensor (NL)</strong></p>


<p>The NL sensor sends low pressure compressor speed information to the FADEC.</p>

<p>There is one Low Pressure Rotor Speed Sensor located on top of the front inlet case next to the MOT probe. The NL sensor is a sealed unit and has two coils. The sensor picks up low pressure rotor speed from a toothed sleeve against the No.2.5 bearing. <br>Each coil sends a NL speed signal to channel A and B of the FADEC respectively.</p>

<div>NL speed is used for:</div>
<ul>
	<li>Controlling the Interstage and Intercompressor bleed valves</li>
	<li>Flight compartment indication</li>
	<li>The FADEC NL speed limit logic and the NL decouple logic</li>
</ul>
