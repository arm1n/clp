<p><strong>P3 Pressure Transducer</strong></p>


<p>The P3 pressure transducer senses compressor discharge pressure at the exit from the HP compressor. The P3 transducer converts this pressure into a proportional electrical signal and sends it to the FADEC.</p>

<p>The transducer is located on the cyclonic de-aerator. It is connected to the gas generator case by a stainless steel tube and to the FADEC through an electrical wiring harness. </p>

<p>The P3 transducer is a 2 channel device. In the event one channel fails the other channel can fully provide the signal to the FADEC.</p>
