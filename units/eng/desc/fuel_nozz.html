<p><strong>Fuel Nozzle Adapters</strong></p>


<p>The purpose of the fuel nozzle adapters is to deliver fuel to the combustion chamber, mix it with air and atomize it for combustion. The twelve fuel nozzle adapters are installed on the turbine support case. The nozzle part of the adapter is inserted in the turbine support case and is directed towards the front of the engine. Fuel manifolds connect the fuel nozzles together.</p>

<p>All twelve fuel nozzle adapters are duplex units that have both primary and secondary orifices. The primary fuel orifice is located in the center of the nozzle and the secondary fuel orifices surround the primary orifice. The primary fuel orifices are supplied with fuel by the primary fuel manifold and the secondary orifices are supplied by the secondary fuel manifold.</p>


<clp-expandable name="Fuel Manifolds Description">

	<p><strong>Fuel Manifolds</strong></p>
	<p>The purpose of the fuel manifolds is to deliver fuel to the fuel nozzle adapters. There are two manifolds on the engine; one on the left side and one on the right side. Each fuel manifold connects six fuel nozzle adapters to the FDV.</p>
	<p>Each fuel manifold consists of six manifold adapters that are equally spaced. Manifold adapters are interconnected by two flexible hoses, one for the primary fuel path and one for the secondary fuel path.</p>

<clp-expandable name="Flow Divider Valve Description">

	<p><strong>Flow Divider Valve</strong></p>
	<p>The purpose of the flow divider valve (FDV) is to divide the fuel flow between the primary and secondary fuel manifolds for starting and steady state operation. Two fuel manifolds, left and right, are connected to the FDV. Each fuel manifold has two connections to the FDV, one for the primary fuel flow and one for the secondary fuel flow. A fire shield is mounted around the ecology reservoir for fire resistance purposes.</p>

	<p>During start, fuel from the FMU flows into the FDV and starts to feed the divider valve. A pressure regulator is used to maintain primary fuel pressure 125 psi (862 kPa) above the secondary fuel pressure. The excess fuel flow is bled to the secondary manifold through the regulator. Fuel stored in the ecology reservoir is also returned to the manifolds through the action of the ecology piston. A restricted orifice in the ecology circuit makes sure of a slow transition of the piston, so as not to affect the fuel nozzle operation during start.</p>

	<p>At low fuel flow conditions, fuel is routed to both the primary and secondary manifolds, while the pressure regulator maintains a constant pressure differential between them. As fuel flow increases, the FDV equalizes the pressure between primary and secondary to limit the maximum pressure of the system. Equalization is maintained up to the maximum flow condition.</p>

	<p>When the engine is shut down, the fuel remaining in the fuel manifolds is collected in an ecology reservoir integral to the FDV by the action of a piston and a spring. This fuel is used on the next engine start.</p>
