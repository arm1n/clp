<p><strong>Oil Cooler</strong></p>

<p>The oil cooler system removes excess heat from the oil. The oil cooler is in the oil pressure circuit of the engines. The assembly has the oil cooler unit, the bypass valve, the air inlet duct, and the exit duct. </p>

<p>The oil cooler uses the air from the engine air intake to cool the oil. The air inlet duct is welded to the oil cooler. It directs airflow through the oil cooler. The exit duct is not part of the assy. The oil cooler is attached with twelve bolt and anchor nuts between two brackets at the engine firewall structure.</p>

<p><strong>Oil Cooler Bypass Valve </strong></p>


<p>The oil cooler bypass valve is to bypass some, or all, of the oil to control oil temperature. The valve also provides protection for the oil cooler in the event of overpressure.</p>

<div>It does these functions:</div>
<ul>
	<li>A thermal function lets the engine oil fully bypass the oil cooler at temperatures below 170 F (77 C). Above 185 F (85.0 C) the engine oil continues to go through the oil cooler</li>
	<li>A pressure relief function lets the engine oil release if the oil cooler becomes blocked during cold oil operation. The pressure relief op- erates at 23 psid (158.6 kPad)</li>
	
</ul>
