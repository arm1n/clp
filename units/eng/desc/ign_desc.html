<p><strong>Egnition Exciter Purpose</strong></p>


<p>The ignition exciter transforms a DC voltage input into a pulsed high voltage output. This pulsed
	output causes the ignitor plugs to create the sparks that will ignite the fuel/air mixture.
	The Ignition Exciter Box is a dual channel unit contained in a single enclosure. The Ignition
	Exciter Box is supplied with aircraft 28 Vdc through a single electrical connector for both
	channels.</p>

<p>It outputs a high-tension signal to the igniter plugs when selected "ONâ€œ by the FADEC.The
	Ignition Exciter Box is connected to the Igniter Plugs by a pair of braided cables.Each channel
	of the FADEC can fire either or both the ignition plugs.</p>

	<clp-text-red><b></b>Warning:</clp-text-red>
	<p>High energy in the ignition system can be fatal. This high voltage output causes the
		ignition plugs to spark at a rate of 1 to 1.4 sparks per second. When the unit is energized, a
		capacitor on the high voltage side of the output transformer is progressively charged.</p>

<br>
<p>When sufficient energy to ionize a spark gap in the unit is accumulated, the capacitor discharges through a dividing and step-up transformer network across the two ignition plugs. The unit will continue functioning if one of the plugs is open or shorted, in order to operate the remaining plug. If both ignition plugs fail, or if the input voltage is switched off, the capacitor automatically discharges. The two Igniter Plugs are located in the Gas Generator Case.</p>
