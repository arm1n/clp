<clp-img src="./units/eng/desc/pic/eng_int_heater_info.svg" width="400" ></clp-img>

<p>The air intake deicing system has electrical heating elements on the inner surface of the intake 
adapter.The engine air intake is integrally anti-iced by reduction gear box scavenge oil heat.</p>

<p>The engine air intake adaptor deicing includes two 1200 W electrical heating elements (one main 
and one spare).  The engine air intake adapter heaters are energized by the 115 Vac B phase variable frequency bus.</p>

<p>Each heated adapter is controlled by the ENG INTAKE switchlights on the ICE PROTECTION panel.</p>


	
<div>Power is supplied to the heater through a relay when all of these cond. are correct:</div>
	
<ul>
	<li>Temperature measured by a thermostat in the fuselage is below +60 F (+15.6 C)</li>
	<li>Related engine oil pressure switch is closed</li>
	<li>ENGINE INTAKE switchlight has been pushed</li>
	<li>115 Vac power is available</li>
	
</ul>

<p>When an ENGINE INTAKE switchlight is pushed, the bypass door of that engine starts to open to evacuate ice pieces shed from nacelle inlet components. The OPEN or CLOSED lights show the position of the related bypass doors.</p>

<p>When the heaters are powered, the HTR lights in the ENGINE INTAKE switchlights (on the ICE PROTECTION control panel) come on.</p>
