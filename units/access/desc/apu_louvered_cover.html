<p><strong>Inlet Louvered Cover:</strong></p>


<p>The inlet louvered cover is installed during the de-ice season to 
prevent de-ice fluid of entering the apu inlet duct.</p>

<p>It is removed in the beginning of the summer operation to prevent 
overheating of the APU due to too less inlet air flow.</p>
