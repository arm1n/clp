<p><strong>Ice Shields</strong></p>

<p>The ice shields are installed on the left and right sides of the middle center fuselage surfaces. These shields are installed on the plane of the propellers to protect the fuselage pressure shell from damage due to ice being thrown from the propellers.</p>

<p>On aircraft with IS4Q5350010 incorporated, an additional ice shield extension is installed on the left side of the middle center fuselage surface, aft of the main ice shield.</p>
