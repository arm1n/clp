<p><strong>WX RADAR CONTROL PANEL</strong></p>

<p>The Control Panel (CP) is processor based, and designed to facilitate mode selection of the WXR system within the IMS100 avionics suite.</p>

<p>The Control Panel (CP) has front pushâˆ’buttons, rotary switches and knobs that accept mode selection from the flight crew and converts them to serial ARINC 429 digital data. The data is transmitted to IFC1 and IFC2, and a dedicated power on/off control discrete interface with the ART. The mode selections are converted by the radar control panel to serial ARINC 429 digital data that is sent to the symbol generator.</p>
