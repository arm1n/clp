<p><strong>GAIN knob (push / pull, rotary action)</strong></p>

<p><clp-text-blue><strong>TURN</strong></clp-text-blue> - This rotary control is used to adjust the sensitivity of the radar receiver. Sensitivity increases with clockwise rotation with the receiver gain at maximum when the gain control is at the full clockwise position.</p>

<p><clp-text-blue><strong>PULL</strong></clp-text-blue> - With the control pulled out, variable gain is activated and the message GAIN MAN is annunciated in white in the upperleft corner of the MFD.</p>

<p><clp-text-blue><strong>PUSH</strong></clp-text-blue> - When the knob is pushed in, the preset calibrated gain mode is activated and the gain of the receiver cannot be adjusted by rotation of the GAIN control.</p>


<p><clp-text-blue><strong>NOTE:</strong> Calibrated gain is the normal mode for weather avoidance.
Manual gain control is, however, often used in conjunction with <strong>GMAP</strong> mode.</clp-text-blue></p>
