<p><strong>RCT (Rain Echo Attenuation Compensation Technique, momentary action)</strong></p>

<p><clp-text-blue><strong>PUSH</strong></clp-text-blue> - Enables the REACT circuitry to compensate for the attenuation of the radar signal as it passes through rainfalls. RCT mode can only be set with the system in WX mode. WX RCT is displayed in white on the upper-left corner of the MFD. A subsequent push on the RCT switch disables the function.</p>
<ul>
	<li>RCT mode is active in all ranges and GAIN is automatically set to a preset level according to received signal strength. When the receiver is in its calibration range, displayed colors are as in WX mode. RCT measures magnitude of returned signals along each radial line. Within range of compensation, the full depth of storms will be displayed along each radial.</li>
	<li>The cyan field indicates areas where further compensation is not possible. Any target detected within the cyan field cannot be calibrated and should be considered dangerous. All targets in the cyan field are displayed as fourth level precipitation, magenta
</li>
</ul>
