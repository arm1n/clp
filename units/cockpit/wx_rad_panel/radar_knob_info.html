<p><strong>RADAR knob (5 positions, rotary action)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>sets the weather radar operating modes as follows:</li>
</ul>


<p><clp-text-blue><strong>OFF</strong></clp-text-blue> - This position removes power from radar system and the Receiver / Transmitter / Antenna (RTA) is inhibited with the antenna stowed in a tilt-up position.</p>
<ul>
	<li>No radar transmissions will occur and WX OFF will be annunciated in white text on each MFD (Multi- Functional Display).</li>
</ul>
<br>

<p><clp-text-blue><strong>SBY (Standby)</strong></clp-text-blue> - In this mode the transmitter / receiver electronics within the RTA are powered but no radar transmissions will occur and antenna is stowed in a tilt-up position.</p>
<ul>
	<li>a steady white WX STBY message is displayed in the upper-left corner on each MFD</li>
</ul>
 <clp-info-border>
<clp-text-blue><strong>NOTE:</strong> For power-up, either <strong>SBY</strong> or <strong>TST</strong> mode is selected. When power is first applied, WAIT, in white, is annunciated in the upper-left corner of the MFD for 40 to 100 s while the magnetron warms up. Power sequences <strong>ON - OFF - ON</strong> lasting less than 1 s after the initial wait period result in a 6 s wait period.</clp-text-blue>
	 </clp-info-border>
<br>
<br>

<p><clp-text-blue><strong>WX (Weather)</strong></clp-text-blue> - This position selects the weather detection mode, the system is fully operational and radar transmissions will occur continuously. WX ON is displayed in white on the MFD.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Targets are displayed in various colours. Each colour represents a specific target intensity. In WX mode, 5 precipitation levels as black, green, yellow, red and magenta are displayed.</li>
	<li>When preset GAIN is selected, the colour levels are calibrated to rainfall rates.</li>
	<li><clp-text-blue><strong>NOTE:</strong> If WX is selected before the initial RTA warmup period is complete, the WAIT legend is displayed in white, on the MFD.</clp-text-blue></li>
</ul>
 
<ul>
	<li>If the aircraft is on the ground, the system enters FSBY (Forced Standby) and the radar does not radi- ate. White WX STBY message is displayed on each MFD.</li>
	<li>FSBY may be over-ridden by pushing the STAB button 4 times within 3 s.</li>
</ul>


<br>
<p><clp-text-blue><strong>GMAP (Ground Mapping)</strong></clp-text-blue> - the Ground Map option is annunciated in white, as WX GMAP, in the upper- left corner of the MFD. The system is fully operational and all parameters are set to enhance returns from ground targets.</p>
<ul>
	<li>In ground-mapping mode, video levels of increasing reflectivity are displayed as black, cyan, yellow and magenta.</li>
	<li>The TILT control is turned down until the desired amount of terrain is displayed. The degree of down-tilt depends upon the aircraft altitude and the selected range.</li>
	<li>The selection of preset GAIN generally gives the desired mapping display. However, the crew may decrease the gain manually.</li>
</ul>
<clp-info-border>
<clp-text-blue><strong>NOTE:</strong> If GMAP is selected before the initial RTA warmup period is complete, the WAIT legend is displayed in white, on the MFD.</clp-text-blue>
	 </clp-info-border>
<br>

<p><clp-text-blue><strong>RCT or TGT</strong></clp-text-blue> - modes are not selectable in GMAP.</p>
<br>

<p><clp-text-blue><strong>TST (Test)</strong></clp-text-blue> - The radar is engaged in test mode, performing self-tests and outputting a multi-coloured arc display pattern. The output data includes messages for crew use, fault types and codes, transmit status, maintenance messages.</p>
<ul>
	<li>WX TEST will be annunciated in yellow text on each MFD.</li>
</ul>
<br>
 <clp-info-border>
<clp-text-blue><strong>NOTE:</strong> If the aircraft is airborne the transmitter is on and radiating energy. With the aircraft on the ground, the system enters FSBY and the radar does not radiate. White WX STBY message is displayed on each MFD.</clp-text-blue>

<clp-text-blue><strong>NOTE:</strong> <strong>SLV (Slave)</strong> - Slave mode is only applicable in dual controller installations.</clp-text-blue>
