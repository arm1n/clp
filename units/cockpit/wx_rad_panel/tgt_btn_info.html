<p><strong>TGT (Target Alert, momentary action)</strong></p>

<p><clp-text-blue><strong>PUSH</strong></clp-text-blue> - The Target Alert function can only be selected in WX mode by action on the momentary TGT push-button and is annunciated in white in the upper-left corner of the MFD as WX TGT.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Target Alert monitors beyond the selected range and 7.5Â° on each side of the aircraft heading. If a return with certain characteristics (depth and range) is detected in the monitored area, the message TGT is displayed in a black box continuously flashing in magenta in the top-centre of the radar map area, as a warning condition.</li>
	<li>This annunciation advises the pilot that a potentially hazardous target lies directly in front and outside of the selected range. When this warning is received, the pilot should select longer ranges to view the questionable target.</li>
</ul>

<p><clp-text-blue><strong>NOTE:</strong> <br> Target Alert prevents variable GAIN from being selected.</clp-text-blue></p>
