<p><strong>BLEED CONTROL SELECTOR (rotary action)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>signals ECU to modulate the nacelle shut-off valves</li>
	<li>provides air flow for 1 of 3 selected settings (for engine bleed operation)</li>
</ul>
<br>

<p><clp-text-blue><strong>MIN</strong></clp-text-blue> - allows Environmental Control System (ECS) controller to modulate the amount of bleed air from both engines at a minimum level.</p>

<p><clp-text-blue><strong>NORM</strong></clp-text-blue> - allows ECS controller to modulate the amount of bleed air from both engines at increased levels (for moderate bleed air flow).</p>

<p><clp-text-blue><strong>MAX</strong></clp-text-blue> - allows ECS controller to modulate the amount of bleed air from both engines at increased levels (for maximum bleed air flow).</p>
