<p><strong>AIR CONDITIONING CONTROL PANEL</strong></p>


<p>Temperature control starts with selecting the desired temperature using the appropriate switches on the AIR CONDITIONING control panel in the overhead console in the flight compartment. The ECS Electronic Control Unit (ECU) monitors the temperature sensors and switches located throughout the aircraft. The ECU then operates the appropriate valves to maintain the selected temperature setting. The cabin temperature setting can also be controlled from the flight attendant panel.</p>
