<p><strong>ICE DETECTED MESSAGE</strong></p>


<p>When ice accumulation is sensed the words ICE DETECTED appear on the Engine Display (ED). The ice sensor operates on a piezoelectric principle based on two IDP. It continuously vibrates at its natural resonant frequency and when ice accumulates on the ice sensor, the frequency of vibration increases due to an increase in rigidity.</p>

<p>An ICE DETECTED message appears in white lettering, and is cen- tered just below the Static Air Temperature (SAT) indication. It appears in reverse video for the first five seconds then in normal video when one of two ice detector probes has sensed ice accumulation above its threshold.</p>

<p>Only one advisory message is shown when ice is sensed by one or both Ice Detector Probes (IDP). The message will also <strong>flash until the propeller deice control switch is selected to ON.</strong> Discrete information comes from either sensor through Input/Output Processor (IOP1 or IOP2). The ICE DETECTED message is out of view when no ice is detected.</p>

<p>The ICE DETECTED message will remain in view for a minimum of 60 Â±5 seconds.</p>
