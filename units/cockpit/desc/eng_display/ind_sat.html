<p><strong>STATIC TEMPERATURE INDICATION</strong></p>

<p>The static temperature probe measures the surrounding aircraft Indi- cated Outside Air Temperature (IOAT). It is a flush-attached electrical resistance transmitter with temperature resistance properties.</p>

<p>The accuracy of the resistance over the –50 to +50 C range is ± 1 ohm. This resistance error is equivalent to a temperature accuracy of 0.52 C within this range.</p>

<p>The static temperature probe is attached flush to an access panel in the wing to fuselage fairing below the left wing root with four mounting screws.</p>

		<clp-text-blue><strong>NOTE:</strong> If Pilot reports Prop de-ice caution light cones on without selecting prop de ice, a possible cause is the dual sat probe.</clp-text-blue>

	<p>Please check indication of 1 and 2 temperature indications on Pilots eng display and Copilots eng display for mismatch, a discrepancy of 8°C can cause the problem. </p>
