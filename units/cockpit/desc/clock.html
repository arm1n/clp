<p><strong>Electronic Clock</strong></p>


<p>Each clock operates independently. The No. 1 Clock is interfaced directly with the Cockpit Voice Recorder and both clocks are interfaced with the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) through the Flight Data Processing System (FDPS).<br>
The FDR normally records time from the No. 1 Clock but will switch to No. 2 Clock if the No. 1 Clock fails. Real time is recorded on both the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) and Flight Data Recorder (FDR) to establish synchronization between the two recording systems.</p>
