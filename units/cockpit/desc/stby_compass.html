<p>The standby flight instruments operate independently and do not interface with any other systems.</p>

<p>A standby magnetic compass is located at the top of the windshield center-post. The standby compass must be used in conjunction with the compass correction card in the flight compartment acting adjacent to the compass. The compass card represents the correct readings taken for normal electrical operating loads of the airplane (windshield heat, pitot heat, anti-collision light, etc.).</p>
