<p><strong>FLIGHT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</strong></p>


<p>The UNS - 1E Flight Management System (FMS) is an integrated navigation management system providing the flight crew with navigation, flight planning and fuel management data.</p>

<p>The UNS -1E is a system consisting of a cockpit mounted Multi-functional Control Display Unit (MCDU), Flight Management Computer (FMC) and Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver enclosed in a single Line Replaceable Unit (LRU).<br>
Position information is derived from VOR#1, DME#1 and GPS#1 for the pilotâ€™s side FMS and VOR#2, DME#2 and GPS#2 for the co-pilots side FMS. True airspeed, altitude, static air temperature data, fuel flow data, etc., are routed to each FMS from the Flight Data Processing System (FDPS).</p>

<p>The FMS provides lateral navigation (LNAV) guidance and vertical navigation (VNAV) guidance based on data from the navigation receivers and air data sensors. An FMS approach mode allows the operator to fly flight director or autopilot non-precision approaches.</p>
