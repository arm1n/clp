<p><strong>GPWS and GS Alert Annunciator Switch</strong></p>


<p>A red PULL UP annunciator switch located on the glareshield panel assembly comes on when the Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) calculates any of the warnings that follow:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Mode 1, Excessive descent rate</li>
	<li>Mode 2, Excessive closure rate to terrain</li>
	<li>Mode 3, Descent after takeoff</li>
	<li>Mode 4, Insufficient terrain clearance</li>
	<li>Terrain Clearance Floor (TCF) alerting</li>
	<li>Terrain alerting</li>
</ul>

<p>One BELOW G/S annunciator switch or the other is pushed for 1 second or longer to cancel the voice indication. The amber light stays on to show that the mode was manually cancelled.</p>

<div>The mode automatically stops when any of these conditions are set:</div>
<ul>
	<li>The Above Ground Level (AGL) is less than 50 feet</li>
	<li>The Above Ground Level (AGL) is more than 1900 feet</li>
	<li>The ILS frequency is de-selected</li>
</ul>
