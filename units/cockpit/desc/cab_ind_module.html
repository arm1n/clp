<p>The cabin indication module is located in the flight compartment on the overhead panel and displays differential pressure, cabin altitude and cabin altitude rate of change.<br> The cabin indication module is interfaced with the CPC and ADU's for differential, altitude and rate indications. The differential pressure indicator gives a differential pressure from 0.5 to 5.8 ± 0.15 psi (-3.45 to 40 ±1.03 kPa) between the cabin pressure and the outside static pressure.</p>
<p>An internal absolute cabin pressure sensor performs cabin altitude indication. This sensor's information is 
transmitted on an ARINC 429 data bus to the CPC. This pressure sensor also gives the excessive altitude warning to the Cabin Pressure Controller and the CABIN PRESS warning light. </p>

<p><clp-text-blue><strong>NOTE:</strong> The CABIN PRESS warning light on the Caution and Warning panel 
comes on when the cabin altitude reaches 10,000 ft.</clp-text-blue></p>
