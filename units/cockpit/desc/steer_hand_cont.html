<p><strong>NOSEWHEEL STEERING HAND CONTROL</strong></p>

<p>The hand control, located on the Pilot’s Side panel, is self−centering and operates when the STEERING switch is set to the STEERING position. The nosewheel must be within 70 degrees of center for the steering to work. An index mark on the hand control shows the relative position of the nosewheel against a fixed STEERING RANGE decal. With the STEERING switch set to STEERING, power is directed to the nosewheel Steering Control Unit (SCU), if the nose gear is down and locked with weight-on-wheels.</p>

<p><b>The nosewheel will revert to a passive shimmy dampened castoring mode if the:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Nosewheel angle is greater than 70 degrees </li>
	<li>SCU fails</li>
	<li>STEERING switch is set to OFF</li>
</ul>

<p><b>PTT SWITCH</b></p>
<p>When a push-to-talk (PTT) selection is made by a pilot, speaking into a boom, mask, or hand microphone makes a PA announcement through the cabin speaker network.</p>
