<p><strong>Elevator Trim Indicator</strong></p>

<p>The elevator trim indicator is an analog type gauge located in the flight compartment on the centre console. The LVDTs located in the pitch trim actuators send their signals to the FCECU which then supplies a signal to the elevator trim indicator. The indicator displays elevator trim position as commanded by the trim switches on the pilot's and copilot's control handwheels.</p>

<p>The indicator is labelled <b>“NU”</b> for nose up, <b>“ND”</b> for nose down and <b>“TO”</b> for take-off. A white band next to the <b>“TO”</b> setting shows the amount of elevator trim that is acceptable for take-off.</p>

<p>An aural warning sounds if the power levers are advanced above Flight Idle plus 12 degrees, for take-off, with the elevator trim position outside the take-off range.</p>
