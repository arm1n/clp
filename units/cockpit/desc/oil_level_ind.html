<p><strong>Remote Oil Level Indication System (Optional)</strong></p>


<p>The remote oil level indication system is installed on the Dash 8−400 as an option under CR812CH00006 (written as “system” in this description procedure). The system is non−essential for the operation of the aircraft.</p>

<p>The system gives indication that there is approximately 10 flying hours or less of engine oil (based on normal oil consumption).</p>

<p>The Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) still requires the oil level check using the sight glass and low oil level indicator.
