<p><strong>Pitch Disconnect System</strong></p>

<p>The pitch disconnect system lets the left and right elevator control circuits be disconnected from each other, in the event a jam occurs in either control circuit. The remaining operational circuit controls the pitch of the aircraft around the lateral axis.
	<br><br>
	The pilot's control column operates the left elevator circuit and the copilot's control column operates the right elevator circuit. The two control columns are connected to each other so that either column can operate both elevator circuits at the same time. This lets the aircraft be flown from either the pilot's or copilot's position.
	<br><br>	
	If a jam occurs in either control circuit, the PITCH DISC handle in the flight
	compartment is pulled to disconnect the left elevator circuit from the right elevator circuit. The pilot with the free control column will have pitch control.
