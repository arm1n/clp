<p><strong>Flight Guidance Control Panel</strong></p>


<p>The FGCP has a front face with knobs and switches, and two independent processing channels. The processing channels are located on separate circuit boards and are energised by two separate power sources. The two channels use the same control knobs and switches. </p>

<p>Each knob is clearly labelled to show its function. The course knobs are also etched with bearing pointer symbols and the heading knobs are etched with heading bug symbols to help show their functions. The NOSE DN and NOSE UP label above and below the thumb wheel show its direction of operation.</p>
