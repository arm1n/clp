		<p>The engine start system provides the means to start the engines on the ground and provide re-starts in the air.</p>

<p>Select the ignition switch to the NORMAL position. An engine start is then initiated by selecting the engine and activating the starter by pressing the engine START switch and moving the Condition Lever from the FUEL OFF, to START FEATHER position.</p>


<div>The FADEC ignition system has two flight compartment selectable modes of operation:</div>
<ul>
	<li>1  OFF: The FADEC disables ignition regardless of ground or flight status.</li>
	<li>2  NORM: FADEC activates ignition during engine starts (ground or flight starts). FADEC commands both ignitors On during flameout and surge accommodation.</li>
</ul>
