<p><strong>Ground Crew Annunciator Switch</strong></p>

<p>When the ground crew headset is plugged into a service interphone jack, the GND CREW advisory light on the pilotâ€™s side console comes on with an applicable FWD or AFT indication to show a service interphone connection. When the ground crew headset is plugged into the forward fuselage ground crew jack, the FWD advisory light comes on. When the ground crew headset is plugged into the aft fuselage ground crew or fueling panel ground crew jack, the AFT advisory light comes on. The FWD and AFT advisory lights alert the flight crew that interphone communication with a ground crew station may be made, and also indicates the station.</p>

<p>A Weight-Off-Wheels (WOFW) signal from the Proximity Sensor Electronics Unit (PSEU) causes the ground crew interphone function to go off in flight.
