<p></p>


<div><b>SYSTEM LOW pressure (Amber) </b></div>
<p>Illuminated when the hydraulic accumulator pressure is below 1700 PSI. If this indication is illuminated, door actuation hydraulic pressure is insufficient to ensure proper modulated flow control.</p>

<div><b>E-DROP ELEC fail (Amber)</b></div>
<p>Illuminated when electrical power is not present at the EMERGENCY DROP button. If this indication is illuminated, an emergency drop is not possible.</p>

properly.</p>

<div><b>E-DROP LOW pressure (Amber) </b></div>
<p>Illuminated when the emergency hydraulic accumulator pressure is below 
1700 PSI. If this indication is illuminated, an emergency drop is not guaranteed.</p>

<div><b>EMERGENCY DROP (RED)</b></div>

<p>Button (red) that allows for the use of stored emergency hydraulic system
