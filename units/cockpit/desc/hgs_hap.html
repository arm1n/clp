<p><strong>HGS Annunciator Panel (HAP)</strong></p>


<p>The HGS Annunciator Panel (HAP) is a low-profile, surface mount panel that provides eleven annunciations that allow the First Officer to monitor HGS operation. Provides HGS information about AIII mode, rollout and takeoff guidance, approach warnings and HGS failures.</p>


<p>The HAP is connected to the aircraftâ€™s CAUT/ADVSY and BRT/DIM test switches.<br>
Pushing the TEST pushbutton on the HCP also starts a 5-second HAP LED test.</p>

<p>BITE in the HAP ensures that the HAP is operating correctly. A no fault condition results in a ground on the BITE connection between the HAP and Computer. <br>
An open on this line indicates a fault. When the Test mode is active, fault codes are displayed on the HCP and on the Existing Faults page available on the Maintenance Menu.</p>
