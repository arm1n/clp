<p><strong>Caution and Warning Annunciator Panel</strong></p>

<p>The caution and warning lights provide a visual indication to the flight crew of a non-normal condition.<br>
The lights are housed in a panel located forward of the overhead console. Amber caution lights turn on to indicate a caution, while red warning lights turn on to indicate a warning.</p>

<p>A MASTER WARNING and MASTER CAUTION light, located at eye level on the center glareshield panel, flashes to alert the flight crew of a system fault or warning. Simultaneously, the associated systemâ€™s caution light turns on steady or warning light flashes on the CAUTION/WARNING panel. The MASTER CAUTION light is associated with one chime, and the MASTER WARNING light is associated with three chimes.</p>


<p>Pressing either the MASTER CAUTION or MASTER WARNING light resets that light. Pressing the MASTER WARNING light also causes the fault causing panel warning light to stop flashing and remain on steady. If a subsequent fault occurs from another system, the MASTER CAUTION or MASTER WARNING light flashes with the new caution light. A caution/warning light remains on as long as the non-normal condition exists.</p>


<p>The FUELING ON caution light turns only when refueling or defueling is in progress, but does not cause the MASTER CAUTION light to turn on.</p>
