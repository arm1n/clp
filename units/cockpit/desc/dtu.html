<p><strong>DATA TRANSFER UNIT (DTU)</strong></p>


<p>The Data Transfer Unit (DTU) is designed to be mounted in the aircraft and used to update the FMS navigation data base within
minutes. A portable unit is also available for multiâˆ’aircraft operations.</p>

<p>The DTU is connected directly to the FMS such that the data is transmitted directly to the FMS during the update process. The
update data will refresh the entire navigation data base with each update.</p>
