<p><strong>Main landing gear alternate release Handle</strong></p>


<p>When the main LANDING GEAR ALTERNATE RELEASE door on the flight compartment 
ceiling is opened it mechanically opens a bypass valve in the normal hydraulic extension 
system, and gives access to the MAIN L/G RELEASE handle. Pulling the handle releases 
the main landing gear doors and uplocks. The main gear will free fall but may not fully 
extend.</p>

<p>The LANDING GEAR ALTERNATE EXTENSION door, on the flight compartment floor, must 
then be fully opened giving access to the alternate extension handpump
If the MLG does not reach the down and locked position, the extension pump handle, 
located behind the copilot, is inserted into the pump handle socket and operated to 
complete main gear extension and subsequent downlock.</p>
