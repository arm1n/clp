<p><strong>Pitot-Static Isolation Valve</strong></p>


<p>The pitot-static isolation valve panel has a NORM/ISOL annunciator switch. It is pushed to energize the shutoff valve.</p>

<p>The NORM/ISOL annunciator switch is a guarded annunciator switch. Atransparent switch cover prevents accidental selection of the switch.
The pitot-static isolation valve panel is attached to the bottom leftpart of the instrument panel with two mounting screws. A bonding wire connectedto the chassis makes a ground continuity connection between the control paneland the aircraft structure.</p>

<p>The pitot-static isolation valve provides physical separation between the two pitot-static detection systems. The valve is actuated with the NORM/ISOL annunciator switch.</p>
