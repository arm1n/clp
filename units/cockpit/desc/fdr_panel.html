<p><strong>Flight Data Recorder Ground/Test Panel</strong></p>


<div>The remote switch is used to select the Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) operating 
modes that follow:</div>

<ul>
	<li>Remote AUTO</li>
	<li>Remote ON</li>
	<li>Remote RESET</li>
	
</ul>

<p><b>Remote AUTO Mode:</b> The ELT operates in the automatic mode when the master and the 
remote switches are selected to the AUTO position. The ELT transmits when the inertia 
switch activates. The red ELT monitor light located in the remote switch comes on.</p>

<p><b>Remote ON Mode:</b> The ELT can be manually activated in the event of an emergency by 
selecting the remote switch to the ON position. The ON selection overrides the automatic 
inertia switch. The monitor light located within the remote switch comes on.</p>

<p><b>The Remote ON Mode</b> selection provides a means to test the ELT during a preflight test. 
For test purposes, the ELT may be momentarily activated by placing the remote switch to 
the ON position during a preflight test. Returning the remote switch to the AUTO position 
terminates ELT operation. The monitor light goes off.</p>

<p><b>Remote RESET Mode:</b> The remote RESET mode lets a reset of an inadvertent ELT 
activation. Momentarily placing the remote switch in the RESET position and then to the 
AUTO position, re-arms the ELT and the ELT monitor light goes out.</p>
