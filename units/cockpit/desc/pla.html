<p><strong>POWER QUADRANT</strong></p>

<clp-tabs>
	<clp-tab title="Description">
	
	<p>Power lever movement is limited by fixed stops at both ends of the quadrant. Each lever has the distinct settings that follow:<br>

<p><b>RATING:</b> With the power lever in the RATING, or rated power, detent the engine will deliver the horsepower demanded by the rating (rated power detent).</p>

<p><b>FLIGHT IDLE:</b>The flight idle gate does not impose any restriction, that would cause the pilot to perform a separate action before being able to reach the rated power setting. The pilot must operate the release lever, to permit entry of the power lever into the ground regime. The operation of the release lever lets only the power lever with the release lever selected, to enter the ground regime. It is not possible to raise the release lever, until the affected power lever is at the flight idle gate. A warning tone is generated if the trigger is lifted during flight.</p>

<p><b>DISC:</b>With the power lever in the DISC detent the engine will supply minimum power.</p>

<p><b>MAX REVERSE:</b>With the power lever in the detent the engine will supply a maximum of 1000 Shaft horsepower (746 kW)</p>

<p>A friction knob for both power levers is installed in the centre console below the power levers. Turning the knob in the FRICTION INCREASE direction, as marked, progressively increases friction and prevents movement. The friction load can be reduced by turing the knob in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>A flight control gust lock handle is installed forward of the power levers. When the handle is in the ON position, the power levers cannot be advanced to the take off position.</p>
