<p><strong>Handwheel Elevator-Trim Switch</strong></p>

<p>A pitch trim split switch is located in the center of the outboard handgrip of each control 
handwheel. The pitch trim switches are split in two. <b>Both halves</b> of the switches must be 
activated for the pitch trim command to proceed.</p>

<p>The switches give manual control of the elevator pitch trim. They are thumb−operated switches, which are spring−loaded to the center−off position. When the switches are pushed forward, a nose-down trim is commanded and when the switches are pulled aft, a nose−up trim is commanded.</p>
