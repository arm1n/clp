<p><strong>Roll Disconnect System</strong></p>

<p>An interconnect rod located under the flight compartment floor joins the aileron and the roll spoiler systems. This allows the ailerons and spoilers to be operated from either the pilot's or copilot's handwheel.</p>

<p>A roll disconnect handle located on the right side of the centre console connects to the roll disconnect mechanism. If a roll jam occurs in either system, the handle is pulled out to the limit and turned through 90 degrees. This isolates the jammed system from the operating system. The unjammed handwheel is now used for roll control of the aircraft (refer to SDS 27-16-00 Roll Disconnect System).</p>

<p>The roll disconnect system has the components that follow:</p>

<p>- Roll Disconnect Handle</p>

<p>- Lever Assembly Roll Disconnect </p>

<p>- Clutch Mechanism Roll Disconnect</p>
