<p><strong>VHF3 Communication CONTROL PANEL</strong></p>

<p><b>VHF Communication</b></p>

<p>There are currently two VHF communication systems installed on the Dash 8 -
Q400MR aircraft operating in the 118 to 137 Megahertz (MHz) frequency
spectrum with 8.33 Kilohertz (kHz) channel spacing.</p>

<p>The Cascade Aerospace modification installs a separate additional VHF Comm
system capable of operating in the extended frequency range of 118 to
151.975kHz.</p>

<p>The Cascade VHF system consists of an extended frequency range VHF
Transceiver and a dedicated VHF Control Unit. The VHF system interfaces to
the existing aircraft Audio Integration System (AIS) for audio monitoring and
transmission control. The Control Unit is installed in the fwd pedestal to tune the
new transceiver.</p>

<p>The new Transceiver replaces the existing VHF3 Comm transceiver used for
ACARS (being removed). The new Transceiver will usje the new VHF/FM
antenna that replaces the existing VHF3 antenna on the lower fuselage of the
aircraft. A new antenna diplexer is added to allow simultaneous operation of the
new VHF and FM communication frequencies through the single antenna.</p>
