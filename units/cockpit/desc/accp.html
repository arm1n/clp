<div>The main functions of the temperature control and indication system are to:</div>

<ul>
	<li>Supply temperature control of the Environmental Control System</li>
	<li>Supply temperature indication to the flight crew</li>
	<li>Sense malfunctions in the system and send fault codes to the fault indication syste</li>
	
</ul>

<p>Temperature control starts with setting the desired temperature using the appropriate 
switches on the AIR CONDITIONING control panel in the overhead console in the flight 
compartment. The Electronic Control Unit (ECU) monitors the temperature sensors and s
witches located throughout the aircraft. The ECU then operates the appropriate valves to 
maintain the selected temperature setting.</p>
