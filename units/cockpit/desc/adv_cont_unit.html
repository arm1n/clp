<p><strong>Advisory Lights Control Unit</strong></p>

<p>An Advisory Lights Control Unit (ACU) is used to test and control the brightness of the advisory annunciators. 
It is controlled by the CAUTION/ADVSY LIGHTS toggle switches located on the passenger warning panel.</p>

<p>The signals from different aircraft systems are supplied to the their related advisory annunciator through the ACU. 
A loss of electrical power to the ACU will not prevent individual indicators from coming on when it receives an advisory light signal. 
The advisory test, dim or bright selections will have no effect.</p>

<p>
The advisory control unit receives 28 V dc input or ground input signals from different aircraft systems and supplies them to the 
related advisory lights on the aircraft.</p>
