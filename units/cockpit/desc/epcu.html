<p><strong>Electrical Power Control Unit (EPCU)</strong></p>


<p>The EPCU manually or automatically controls the operation of some contactors in the main 28 Vdc 
generation system. <br> It manually controls contactors by flight compartment toggle switch selections. For example, a manual external DC power selection causes the EPCU to close the external power contactor. </p>

<p>Automatic functions are used to reduce pilot work load and to start protective functions that cannot tolerate the time delay associated with a pilot selection. 
For example, the EPCU automatically causes the external power contactor to open when an over voltage condition is sensed. </p>
