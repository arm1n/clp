<p><strong>CONDITION LEVER QUADRANT MODULE</strong></p>


<p>The <b>Condition Lever System</b> initiates signals to the PEC, to control the propeller blade angles in the forward and reverse ranges. The condition lever also controls fuel on and fuel off, propeller feather and unfeather, and propeller speeds.</p>

<div>The markings of the condition lever detents are as follows:</div>
<ul>
	<li>MAX (1020)</li>
	<li>900 RPM</li>
	<li>MIN (850)</li>
	<li>START FEATHER</li>
	<li>FUEL OFF</li>
</ul>

<p>A spring loaded roller installed in each condition lever, operating in conjunction with the detent track, provides the detents at the positions above. Propeller MAX setting is limited by a fixed stop at the forward end of the quadrant.</p>
