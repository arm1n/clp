<p><strong>Aileron / Rudder Trim Controlâˆ’Panel</strong></p>

<p>The Aileron Trim switch controls the trim actuator and has three positions. The switch is spring- loaded and returns to the centre-off position. The ATCU transfers input commands from the aileron trim actuator to the aileron forward quadrant. The forward quadrant rotates and trans- fers the trim commands to both aileron control surfaces. Therefore aileron trim is accomplished by deflecting both aileron control surfaces. The neutral position of the control wheel is also repositioned. The amount is shown on the aileron trim indicator of the centre console.
</p>

<p>Rudder trim is accomplished by a RUDDER trim control knob. Turning the knob, operates an electrical trim actuator which supplies trim signals to reposition the rudder neutral point of feel unit, and hence, Rudder System neutral. The amount of rudder trim is shown on the RUDDER trim indicator.</p>
