<p><strong>AIR DATA COMPUTER</strong></p>


<p>The two ADC are installed in the flight compartment on the aft bulkhead.The ADC measures static pressure 
(ps) and pitot pressure (pt) supplied from the primary pressure probes and 
compensates these pressures for probe position errors. The ADC also 
measures the temperature probe resistance to calculate Outside Air 
Temperature (OAT).With this data and and the barometric setting data 
supplied by the Index Control Panel (ICP), the ADC does the air data 
calculations. </p>

<p>From these primary parameters and with the acquired barometric setting 
information transmitted by the Index Control Panel (ICP), the ADC does 
the air data calculations.</p>
<br>
<div>The ADC is a Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) that has the components 
that follow:</div>
<ul>
	<li>Mechanical case that secures the pressure ports</li>
	<li>Electrical board with two silicon pressure sensors P90, a CPU, analog and 
   discrete inputs/outputs, ARINC 429 interface, power supply and electrical 
   interface with a connector and EMC protection</li>
</ul>
