<p>The Cabin Pressurization Control Panel contains the required indicators and switches to manage the cabin pressure in Auto, Manual and Dump modes.The cabin pressurization control panel is located in the flight compartment on the overhead panel.</p>

<div><b>The panel has the following mechanical sub-assemblies:</b></div>
<ul>
	<li>FWD OUTFLOW rotary select knob </li>
	<li>AUTO/MAN/DUMP select switch</li>
	<li>Fault alert light</li>
	<li>Landing altitude indicator</li>
	<li>LDG ALT rotary select knob</li>
	<li>MAN DIFF INC/DECR toggle switch</li>
</ul>


<p>The FWD OUTFLOW knob is connected to the reference pressure. The knob controls the pneumatic opening 
of the forward safety valve. When the knob is turned clockwise, the valve opens and it increases the cabin rate of change.</p>

<p>
The AUTO/MAN/DUMP switch is used to set the mode of operation for pressurization control. In the automatic 
mode, the pressurization control is fully automatic. The manual mode is used if the automatic pressurization 
mode does not operate. In the DUMP mode, the out- flow valve is directly driven to the open position and the 
aircraft can be operated unpressurized.</p>

		<clp-td><p>The <clp-text-orange>FAULT</clp-text-orange> alert light gives a visual indication of failures in the cabin pressure control system.
The LDG ALT select knob is set before take-off. A needle is mechanically driven by the LDG ALT knob and 
gives the set landing altitude information to the flight crew. The LDG ALT knob sends a signal to the 
Cabin Pressure Controller. If the landing altitude is not set, the controller input becomes the landing altitude. 
The potentiometer selections are from -2000 to 14,000 ft. (-609.6 to 4267 m).</p></clp-td>

<p>The cabin pressure is set with the toggle switch moved and held to the DECR position, to open the aft outflow 
valve and decrease the cabin differential.When the toggle switch is moved and held to <b>INCR</b>, the aft outflow valve closes and the cabin differential increases.</p>
