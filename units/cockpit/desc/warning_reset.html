<p><strong>Master Warning Switch</strong></p>


<p>When the caution and warning panel senses a warning condition, it causes a related red warning annunciator to come on flashing with the pilotâ€™s glareshield panel master warning switch and three chimes sounds. The master warning switch has a WARNING PRESS TO RESET label.</p>

<p>The caution and warning panel warning annunciator and the master warning switch indication flashes until the master warning switch is pushed. A switch selection causes the caution and warning panel warning indication to change to steady and the master warning indication to go out. When the condition is corrected, the caution and warning panel warning indication goes out.</p>
