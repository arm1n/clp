<p><strong>FIRE PROTECTION PANEL</strong></p>


<p>The fire protection system includes components throughout the aircraft to provide detection, extinguishing and indication of fire conditions. There are eight smoke detectors located on the ceiling panels evenly spaced down the length of the cargo compartment. They are electrically connected to two CEU’s (control electronic unit) that are installed underneath the center aisle floor panel between frames at X71.2 and X94.8. The CEU’s communicate the smoke detection to a fire protection panel.</p>

<p> A fire protection panel has been added to the overhead instrument panel in the flight compartment, which is located adjacent and to the right of the existing fire protection panel. During the cargo freighter role, the independent fire protection system for the passenger role is deactivated.</p>


<p>For the passenger role, the fire protection system consists of the smoke detection system and a halon fire suppression system as originally installed, which are both located in the aft baggage compartment. The previously installed forward baggage compartment was removed. Thus, the accompanying smoke detection and fire suppression system has also been removed. The fire protection panel is also modified to accommodate the removal of the forward baggage compartment. </p>

<p>All buttons, switches, and indicators pertaining to the fire protection system of the forward baggage compartment have been deactivated and covered with a metal plate. During the passenger role, the independent fire protection system for the cargo freighter role is deactivated.</p>
