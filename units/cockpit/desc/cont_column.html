<p><strong>PILOT/CO-PILOT'S CONTROL COLUMN</strong></p>


<p>Roll control is provided by ailerons assisted by flight spoilers. The aileron control system and flight spoiler control system are two independent systems. Both systems are mechanically interconnected to allow simultaneous operation for normal roll control.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Each wing has one aileron and two flight spoilers</li>
	<li>The pilot's wheel controls the flight spoilers</li>
	<li>The copilot's wheel controls the ailerons</li>
	<li>Ailerons are mechanically controlled and cable operated</li>
	<li>Flight spoilers are mechanically controlled and hydraulically powered</li>
</ul>
<p>Pitch control of the aeroplane is maintained by two mechanically controlled, and hydraulically powered elevators. The left control column operates the left elevator and the right control column operates the right elevator. However both control columns are connected to each other by the pitch disconnect system so that they both operate together.</p>

<p>Fore and aft movement of the pilot's and copilot's control columns is transferred through two fully independent cable and pulley control circuits to the elevator Power Control Units (PCU).</p>

<p><b>DROP Button and Modified Autopilot Switch</b> (PILOT/CO-PILOT'S DROP BUTTON)</p>

<p>Provides the pilot with the capability to initiate and terminate a controlled retardant release. Once the controller is armed, this button is enabled and continuously monitored. lf the button is pressed the volume and coverage level which is currently selected will begin. <br>
If the drop button is released before the selected drop is complete, the drop will be terminated by closure of the tank doors. If the drop button is held, the drop will automatically terminate when the selected volume has been released.
