<p><strong>[BALANCE] MESSAGE (yellow, flashings)</strong></p>

<p>Indicates a fuel imbalance condition is detected by the left or right Fuel Gauging Computer (FGC1 or FGC2)</p>

<p>If a fuel imbalance condition is detected (TANK 1 and TANK 2 differ by about 600 lb or 372 kg), a yellow [BALANCE] advisory message is shown just above the FUEL legend of the ED. </p>
<p>The message flashes continuously until a pilot action rectifies the imbalance. </p>

<p>An imbalance condition is also shown on the MFD Fuel page by the analog pointers changing to yellow and both ED digital fuel quantities changing to yellow. Fuel quantity and temperature data is shown in white on the Engine Display (ED) and on the Fuel Page of the Multi Function Display (MFD). White dashes replace the display digits if the data is not valid. On the ED, the BALANCE message will flash yellow and the digital fuel load will also change from white to yellow.</p>

<p>The display changes color to yellow when fuel imbalance exceeds 600 lbs.When the imbalance is less than 600 lbs (272 kg), the QTY needle pointers change from yellow back to white.
</p>

<p>When imbalance is below 600 lbs (272 kg) the BALANCE message is no longer shown, and the digital indication on the ED goes back to white.</p>
