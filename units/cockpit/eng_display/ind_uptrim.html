<p><strong>UPTRIM MESSAGE</strong></p>

<div>The uptrim function is implemented in the PEC hardware, with cross-wing communication from the local PEC to the remote FADEC. Uptrim is armed by moving both PLAs to the rating detent. Uptrim is disarmed by moving either PLA below the detent.When the system is armed an uptrim will occur if:</div>

<ul>
	<li>Both torque signals drop below 25%</li>
	<ul>or</ul>
	<li>Both torque sensors show a speed of less than 80%</li>
</ul>

<p>An uptrim will cause the PEC to command the FADEC to change from the Normal Take-Off Power (NTOP) schedule, to the Maximum Take-Off Power schedule. An UPTRIM message will appear on the ED.</p>
