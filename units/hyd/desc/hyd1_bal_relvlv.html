<p><strong>No.1 Hydraulic System Balanced Relief Valve</strong></p>


<p>The No.1 hydraulic system balanced relief valve (or priority valve) is located in the fuselage-to-wing fairing.</p>

<p>During periods of high system flow demand, this valve stops hydraulic fluid 
flow to the flaps, and the motor side of the Power Transfer Unit (PTU). 
Hydraulic pressure is only supplied to the components necessary for flight control.</p>
