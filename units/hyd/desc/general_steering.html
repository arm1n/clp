<p><strong>Nosewheel Steering System</strong></p>

<p>Directional control on the ground is by the nosewheel steering (NWS) system, powered by the <b>No. 2 hydraulic system.</b> Steering control is by either the Steering Hand Control or the rudder pedals.</p>

<p>The Steering Hand Control turns the nosewheel up to 70° either side of center for low speed taxi. Steering with the rudder pedals turns the nosewheel up to 8° either side of center for high-speed taxi, take-off and landing roll. After take-off, the nosewheel automatically centers before retraction.</p>
