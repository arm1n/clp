<p><strong>Flap System</strong></p>


<p>Two single-slotted inboard and outboard fowler flaps are attached to the trailing edge of each wing. The flaps are connected to screw jacks which are operated by a primary drive shaft. A Flap Power Unit (FPU) actuated by the flap selector, operates the flap drive sys- tem (Figure 12.8-23) and moves the flaps to their selected positions.</p>

<p>The flap surfaces are electronically controlled by the FCU and operated by No.1 hydraulic operated system.</p>
