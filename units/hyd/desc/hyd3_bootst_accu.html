<p><strong>Bootstrap Accumulator</strong></p>


<p>The bootstrap accumulator provides force to pressurize the No. 3 hydraulic system reservoir. </p>

<p>The bootstrap contains a small-area piston exposed to the system pressure, nominally 3000 psi 
(20684 kPa), which provides force to drive the low-pressure piston in the reservoir and keeps it pressurized.</p>
