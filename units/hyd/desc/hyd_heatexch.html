<p><strong>Hydraulic Fluid to Fuel Heat Exchanger</strong></p>


<p>The No.1 and No.2 hydraulic systems each include an oil-to-fuel heat exchanger to supply cooling of the hydraulic system. Hydraulic fluid from the pump case drain is sent to the heat exchanger, located in the fuel tank.</p>

<p>After flowing through the heat exchanger, the hydraulic fluid returns to the reservoir.</p>
