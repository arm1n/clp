<p><strong>Rudder Control System</strong></p>


<p>The rudder control system provides directional control of the aeroplane. The rudder consists of two sections, the fore rudder and trailing rudder. The fore rudder is attached to the vertical stabilizer and operated by two Power Control Units (PCUs). The PCUs are installed one above the other in the vertical stabilizer.</p>

<p><b>No. 1</b> hydraulic system powers the <b>lower PCU</b> and<br> 
	 <b>No. 2</b> hydraulic system powers the <b>upper PCU.</b> 
	<br>
	<br>
	
	Moving the rudder pedals operates both PCUs. If either hydraulic system fails, the remaining PCU pro- vides rudder control.</p>
