<p><strong>No.1 and No.2 Hydraulic System Reservoirs</strong></p>


<p>The hydraulic system reservoirs store hydraulic fluid and supply the necessary fluid volume to the hydraulic systems. </p>

<p>The reservoir is a bootstrap type that provides a 55 psi (379 kPa) suction pressure to the EDPs. A pressure bleed/
relief valve is installed in the reservoir to supply pressure relief of the hydraulic system at 80 psi (552 kPa). 
The bleed/relief valve may also be manually opened to bleed air from the reservoir or to take a hydraulic 
fluid sample. The volume of the No.1 system reservoir is 8 US qt (7.57 L). The volume of the No.2 system reservoir 
is 12 US qt (11.4 L).</p>

<p>The System 1 and System 2 reservoir assemblies are used to control the firewall shutoff valve (FWSOV) and the System Isolation Valve (SIV). </p>

<p>Each hydraulic system reservoir has a quantity transducer to transmit the quantity of fluid in the reservoir to the 
flight compartment. The quantity transducers are installed on each of the three hydraulic system reservoirs. The 
quantity transducer sends an electrical signal to the data acquisition unit which shows system fluid quantity 
on the MFD. </p>

<p>1 & 2 HYD FLUID HOT CAS Indication(Crew Alerting System)
These CAS indications inform the cockpit crew that the hydraulic system fluid temperature is <clp-text-red><b>greater than 225°F.</b></clp-text-red> Note that if this fluid temperature rise continues, the FWSOV will automatically close when hydraulic fluid temperatures <clp-text-red><b>exceed 275°F.</b></clp-text-red> Both temperature switches must be indicating high.</p>
