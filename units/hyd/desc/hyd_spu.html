<p><strong>STANDBY POWER UNIT (SPU)</strong></p>


<p>The No.1 hydraulic system Standby Power Unit (SPU) supplies backup power to the No.1 hydraulic system. The SPU operates during takeoff and landing and during a No.1 engine failure indicated by low oil pressure condition. The SPU is an AC electrically-operated pump normally powered by the right side electrical ac bus.</p>

<p>Backup power to the SPU is supplied by the left side electrical bus. The SPU is installed in the No.1/left side engine nacelle.</p>

<br>
<p><strong>SPU Control Logic</strong></p>
<div>The SPU contactor will be energized (SPU on) when:</div>

<ul>
	<li>SPU selector PBA cockpit switch is “ON”, or</li>
	<li>Hydraulic Reservoir 1 is not empty and Parking Brake Lever is not set and Flap Lever is > 0°, or</li>
	<li>Engine 1 oil pressure is low and the aircraft is in the air (NOT WOW)</li>
	<li>The SPU contactor and circuit breaker are located within the Right AC Contactor Box.</li>
	<li>This CAS indication informs the cockpit crew that hydraulic System 1 standby hydraulic pump (a 3 phase, AC motor driven hydraulic pump) electrical motor is hot. This signal comes from a thermal switch within the SPU.</li>
	
</ul>
