<p><strong>Power Transfer Unit</strong></p>


<p>The Power Transfer Unit (PTU) is a fixed displacement, one-directional device used to supply backup power to
	the No.2 hydraulic system. The PTU is installed in the fuselage-to-wing fairing.</p>

<p>The PTU transfers hydraulic power from the No.1 hydraulic system to the No.2 hydraulic system without
	sharing fluid between the systems. Hydraulic pressure from the No.1 system powers the PTU motor, that operates
	the pump-side of the PTU to power the No.2 hydraulic system.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PTU Control Logic</b></p>

<p>The PTU hydraulic control solenoid will be energized (PTU on) when:</p>



<ul>
	<li>PTU selector Push-Button Annunciator (PBA) cockpit switch is “ON” <clp-text-red>OR</clp-text-red></li>
	<li>Hydraulic Reservoir 2 is not empty and parking Brake Lever is not set<br> <clp-text-red>AND</clp-text-red> Flap Lever is > 0° <br><clp-text-red>AND</clp-text-red> EDP 1 Pressure Switch is indicating high pressure and PTU Pressure Switch does not indicate low pressure within 30 seconds when automatically commanded on</li>
</ul>
<br>

	<p><b>NOTE:</b></p>
	<p>The automatic control of the PTU will be latched out (i.e. electrical
		power must be cycled to the PTU control circuitry, refer to “HYD PWR XFR”
		circuit breaker) if it does not produce pressure for more than 30 seconds when
		automatically commanded to do so.</p>
