<p><strong>Isolation Valve, Operation</strong></p>


<p>The pilot-actuated isolation valve is a balanced spring-loaded spooland sleeve assembly. The valve is “normally-closed” since the outlet (OUT) port is isolated until adequate pilot pressure is applied to the pilot piston through the PILOT port. Actuating pressure at the pilot port is 1445 psig minimum.</p>

<p>When PILOT pressure reaches 1445 to 1545 psig, the pilot piston pressesthe spool against spring force. The spool connects the inlet (INL) port with the OUT port and allows flow.</p>


<p>When PILOT pressure is removed (falls below 1445 psig), spring forcepresses the spool into the isolated position. The face of the spool pressingagainst the pilot piston is slotted. The slot allows return (RTN) flow to andfrom the cavity formed by the sleeve and the face of the piston through thehydraulic passage in the core of the spool.</p>

<p>The thermal relief allows hydraulic fluid to bleed from the INL port through thethermal relief to the RTN port while the INL port is below 500 psig. When INLport pressure reaches 500 psig, the INL pressure on the thermal relief valvespool presses the spool against spring pressure cutting off the RTN port flowpath. A stop is provided to prevent over travel of the spool.</p>
