<p><strong>LANDING GEAR</strong></p>

<p>The landing gear is operated by the <b>No. 2 hydraulic system</b> and is controlled by the landing gear selector lever on the LANDING GEAR control panel. There is an alternate (emergency) means of extension for the main and nose landing gear. Advisory lights give extension/retraction and fail/safe information.</p>

<p>The Proximity Sensor Electronic Unit (PSEU) controls the landing gear, hydraulically operated gear doors and related advisory lights. It also monitors Weight-on-Wheels (WOW) sensors.</p>
