<p><strong>No.1 and No.2 Hydraulic System Isolation Valves</strong></p>


<p>The No.1 and No.2 hydraulic systems each include an isolation valve. The isolation valve stops the flow of hydraulic fluid if the reservoir contents drop below 80 in³ (1311 cm³).</p>

<div>No.1 hydraulic system isolation only allows fluid flow to the components 
that follow: </div>
<ul>
	<li>Flaps</li>
	<li>PTU</li>
	<li>Rudder</li>
	<li>Elevators</li>
</ul>

<p>The isolation valve is operated by spring force and pilot pressure controlled by a reservoir level sensing valve, installed in the reservoirs.</p>

<p><b>LH HYD ISO VLV CAS Indication</b></p>

<p>These CAS indications inform the cockpit crew that the hydraulic reservoir quantity is low and various hydraulic system users have been isolated. For hydraulic System 1, <clp-text-red>brakes and inboard spoilers have been de-pressurized.</clp-text-red> </p>

<p>This signal comes from a pressure switch on the isolated side of the isolation valve.</p>

<p>Two pressure switches are installed on each of the No.1 and No. 2 hydraulic system 
isolation valves. These pressure switches monitor hydraulic pressure at the inlet and 
outlet ports of the isolation valve. When low pressure (less than 900 psi = 6205 k Pascal) 
is sensed at the outlet pressure switch, the #1 or #2 HYD ISO VLV caution light comes on. </p>
