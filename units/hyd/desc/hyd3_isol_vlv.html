<p><strong>Isolation Valve</strong></p>


<p>An isolation valve is used in the No. 3 hydraulic system to isolate the elevators from hydraulic pressure. The No. 3 hydraulic system isolation valve is closed (energized) during normal flight operation. When open, the isolation valve allows hydraulic pressure to power the elevators. </p>

<p>The isolation valve will open in flight if the No 1 and/or No. 2 hydraulic system pressure is low or if the 
No. 1 and No. 2 engine oil pressure is low. The isolation valve can be manually opened from the flight compartment when 
the HYD #3 ISOL VLV switch on the HYDRAULIC CONTROL Panel is set to OPEN.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HYDRAULIC SYSTEM #3 ISOLATION VALVE ELECTRICAL SEQUENCE OF OPERATION.</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>The system operation is centered on the system #3 isolation push-button switch. </li>
	<li>The #3 hydraulic system isolation valve is closed (energized) during normal flight.</li>
	<li>When set to OPEN, the isolation valve opens (deenergized) when any of the following conditions occurs:</li>
</ul>

<br>
<div><b>Conditions 1</b></div>
<ul>
	<li>Weight NOT on wheels, and</li>
	<li>#1 and/or #2 hyd. system pressure is low.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<div><b>Conditions 2</b></div>
<ul>
	<li>Weight NOT on Wheels, and</li>
	<li>#1 and #2 eng. oil pressure is low.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<div><b>Conditions 3</b></div>
<ul>
	<li>manually when the HYD #3 ISOL VLV switch, located on the HYDRAULIC CONTROL Panel in the flight compartment, is set to OPEN</li>
</ul>
