<p><strong>Case-Drain Filter for the No. 2 Engine Driven Pump</strong></p>


<p>SB 84-29-21 Main Hydraulic System No. 2 - Addition of Separate Case-Drain Filter for the No. 2 Engine Driven Pump - ModSum 4-113545</p>


<p><b>Problem:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Many operators have reported highunscheduled removalrate of the No. 2 engine driven pump (EDP). Investigations revealed that failure is due to overheating.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<p><b>Cause:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>When the power transfer unit (PTU) is running, reduced case-drain flow of the No. 2 EDP causes overheating of the No. 2 EDP.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>This Modification is designed to improve reliability of system No. 2 EDP by separating case-drain filters. This will reduce the back pressure and increase its cooling flow. This will lower EDP operating temperature and reduce the number of EDP removals due to overheating.Separation of case-drain filters will also provide independent filtering of the pump case-drain lines.<br> In addition, removing bypass in existing filter manifold will eliminate contaminating the rest of the hydraulic system and reduce the potential return to service tasks.</li>
</ul>
