<p><strong>Brake system accumulator </strong></p>


<p>The accumulator is installed in the right wing root area. It supplies hydraulic pressure for the parking 
brake operation when the engines are stopped, or if No.2 hydraulic pressure fails. The accumulator is 
a cylindrical piston type with a gross rated volume of 50 inches³ (820 centimeters³).</p>

<p>The accumulator is pressurized with nitrogen on one side of the internal piston and hydraulic fluid on 
the other side.</p>

<p>The gas side of the accumulator is pre-charged to 500 psi (3447 kPa). The fluid side 
is pressurized by the No.2 hydraulic system or the handpump. The fluid side will hold enough 
pressure to supply six full parking brake applications and releases.</p>

<p>The charge valve and gauge are installed in the right wing root and are connected to 
the gas pressure side of the accumulator. The gauge supplies an indication of the 
accumulator pressure. 
The charge valve is used to charge the gas side of the accumulator with nitrogen. </p>
