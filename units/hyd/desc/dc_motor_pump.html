<p><strong>System DCMP</strong></p>


<p>The DC Motor Pump (DCMP) is used in the No. 3 hydraulic system, with the accumulator, to pressurize the No. 3 system. </p>

<p>Electrical power is supplied to the DCMP by the STBY battery through the dc battery bus. The DCMP will operate intermittently during normal flight to maintain a No. 3 system pressure range of 2600 to 3250 psi (17926 to 22407 kPa).</p>

<p>DCMP operation is controlled by two pressure switches installed on the accumulator isolation valve. </p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b></p>
<p>The DCMP will operate intermittently on the ground when the dc battery bus is energized by the batteries or external ground power.</p>
