<p><strong>Engine-Driven Pumps</strong></p>


<p>Each pump supplies full, primary system pressure of 3000 psi (20684 kPa).</p>

<p>Each Engine-Driven Pump (EDP) is a variable displacement pressure compensated multi-piston 
hydraulic pump. The pumps vary the fluid flow volume to maintain optimum system pressure. 
The suction, pressure and case drain ports of the pumps are connected by flexible hoses to 
the hydraulic systems.</p>

<p>The EDP's are installed on the reduction gearbox of both the No.1 and No.2 engines. The pumps 
are flange attached by studs, washers and nuts. The pumps are splined to the reduction gearbox.</p>
