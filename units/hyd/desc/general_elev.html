<p><strong>Elevator Control System</strong></p>

<p>Pitch control of the aeroplane is maintained by two mechanically controlled, and hydraulically powered elevators. The elevators are attached to the trailing edge of the left and right horizontal stabilizers. The left control column operates the left elevator and the right control column operates the right elevator. However both control columns are connected to each other by the pitch disconnect system so that they both operate together. Fore and aft movement of the pilot's and copilot's control columns is transferred through two fully independent cable and pulley control circuits to the elevator Power Control Units (PCU).</p>

<p>There are three identical hydraulic PCUs (outboard, centre and inboard) on each elevator. The outboard and centre PCUs on each elevator are active at all times while the inboard PCU is a standby.

	The <b>No. 1</b> hydraulic system supplies power to the <b>left and right outboard PCUs.</b> <br>
	The <b>No. 2</b> hydraulic system supplies power to the <b>left and right centre PCUs.</b> <br>
	The <b>Standby No. 3</b> hydraulic system supplies power to the <b>left and right inboard</b> standby PCUs when required.</p>
