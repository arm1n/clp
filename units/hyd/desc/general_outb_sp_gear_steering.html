<p><strong>Spoiler Control</strong></p>

<p>There is an inboard and outboard roll spoiler panel on each wing. The roll spoilers operate with the ailerons to assist roll control of the aeroplane in flight. The roll spoilers extend and retract by hydraulically powered Power Control Units (PCUs).</p>

<p>No. 1 hydraulic system powers the inboard roll spoiler and <b>No. 2 hydraulic system powers the outboard roll spoiler.</b></p>

<p><strong>LANDING GEAR</strong></p>

<p>The landing gear is operated by the <b>No. 2 hydraulic system</b> and is controlled by the landing gear selector lever on the LANDING GEAR control panel. There is an alternate (emergency) means of extension for the main and nose landing gear. Advisory lights give extension/retraction and fail/safe information.</p>

<p>The Proximity Sensor Electronic Unit (PSEU) controls the landing gear, hydraulically operated gear doors and related advisory lights. It also monitors Weight-on-Wheels (WOW) sensors.</p>

<p><strong>Nosewheel Steering System</strong></p>

<p>Directional control on the ground is by the nosewheel steering (NWS) system, powered by the <b>No. 2 hydraulic system.</b> Steering control is by either the Steering Hand Control or the rudder pedals.</p>

<p>The Steering Hand Control turns the nosewheel up to 70° either side of center for low speed taxi. Steering with the rudder pedals turns the nosewheel up to 8° either side of center for high-speed taxi, take-off and landing roll. After take-off, the nosewheel automatically centers before retraction.</p>
