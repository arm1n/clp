<p><strong>PARKING BRAKE SYSTEM</strong></p>


<p>The emergency/parking brake system lets the brakes be applied if the normal brake system fails, or for setting the parking brake. An EMERG BRAKE lever on the Engine Control quadrant operates the system. The emergency/parking brake system is powered by <b>No. 2 hydraulic system</b>, or by <b>parking brake accumulator pressure.</b> Hydraulic pressure to the emergency/parking brake system is shown on the PK BRK indicator on the PERMANENT SYSTEMS AREA (PSA) of the MFD.</p>

<p>The EMERG BRAKE lever operates against a spring to produce a resistance proportional to the brake pressure applied as the lever is pulled back. There is no differential braking and no anti skid protection when using the EMERG BRAKE lever. If the emergency/parking brake system is used with No. 2 hydraulic system inoperative, the accumulator supplies brake pres- sure. A fully charged accumulator is sufficient for approximately six applications.</p>
