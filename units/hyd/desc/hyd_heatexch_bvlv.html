<p><strong>Hydraulic System Heat Exchanger Bypass Valves</strong></p>


<p>The heat exchanger bypass valve is installed between the heat exchanger inlet and outlet line 
on each of the No.1 and No.2 hydraulic systems.</p>

<p>The valve controls the flow of hydraulic fluid from the case-drain to the heat exchanger as a function of fluid temperature.</p>

<p>The valve also functions as a relief valve to let fluid bypass the heat exchanger if there is too 
much of a pressure decrease. </p>

<p>The valve starts to open at <clp-text-red>95째 F (35.0째 C)</clp-text-red> and is fully open at <clp-text-red>125째 F (52째 C).</clp-text-red></p>
