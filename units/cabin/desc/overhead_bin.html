<p><strong>Overhead Storage</strong></p>

<p>The overhead bins are installed in the passenger compartment above the seats. They extend the full length of the passenger compartment on both sides of the aisle. They are used for carry−on luggage and portable emergency equipment storage.</p>

<p>The bins are made from a fibreglass composite material with a honeycomb core. The interior of the bin is painted while the exterior has a plastic laminate decorative finish. The bins are attached to the aircraft structure with support brackets and bin hangers through anti−vibration mounts. Spacers are installed to keep an equal distance between each bin.</p>
