<p><strong>Dado Panels</strong></p>

<p>On Pre NextGen aircraft, the dado panels are made of the composite material with a decorative plastic laminate cover on the cabin side. The panels are installed above the outboard seat track rails and prevent the aircraft structure from the damage. The top of the panels are attached to the aircraft structure with spring clips and the bottom of the panels is attached with screws. The grills in the dado panels are connected to the Environmental Control System (ECS) inlet duct to supply the passenger compartment with conditioned air.</p>
