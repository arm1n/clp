<p><strong>Sidewall Panels and Covering, Passenger Compartment</strong></p>

<p>The passenger compartment sidewall panels are made from two layers of fiberglass reinforced plastic with a decorative plastic laminate on the cabin side. Where required, a window reveal with a mar resistant window lens is installed. The lower portion of the sidewall panels has a durable fabric to protect it from passengers’ feet.</p>

<p>On pre NextGen aircraft, the panels are installed to the structure by trim rails at the top and bottom. They are held in place by threaded release fasteners and are easily removed without the need to remove the overhead storage bins. There is a protective window reveal panel installed between the sidewall panel opening and the aircraft structure. The window reveal is removable without removing the sidewall panel. Close−out panels are fitted between each main sidewall panel.</p>
