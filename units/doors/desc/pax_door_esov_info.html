<p><strong>Electro pneumatic Shutâˆ’ Off Valve</strong></p>


<p>The solenoid operated valve is installed on the relief port line of the forward passenger door seal pressurization valve. On the ground when the door is unlocked, the handle mechanism operates the control valve and connects the door seal port to the relief port inside the valve and the seal deflates. The seal deflation pressure passes through this shut-off valve to the ambient air.</p>

<p>The primary function of this electro pneumatic shut-off valve is to <b>prevent depressurization</b> of the door seal system if airspeed is more than <b>100 knots</b> (airspeed > 100 knots).</p>

<p>If the airspeed is 90 knots or on the ground the valve will allow the door seal system to be depressurized.</p>

<p>This feature prevents inadvertent door seal depressurization for the forward passenger door. The airspeed
signals to the valve are provided by the aircraft air data system.</p>
