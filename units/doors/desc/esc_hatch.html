<p><strong>Escape Hatch Seal (821)</strong></p>


<p>The flight compartment escape hatch completely detachable, or can be partially opened to increase the airflow in the flight compartment when the aircraft is on the ground. A rope helps the flight crew exit the flight compartment aircraft when using the flight compartment emergency escape hatch.</p>
