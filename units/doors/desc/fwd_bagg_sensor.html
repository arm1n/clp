<p><strong>Forward Baggage Door Monitoring</strong></p>


<p>The position of the forward baggage door is monitored by two proximity sensors. One sensor is located at the upper fixed roller and make sure that the door is closed. The other sensor is located at the handle and makes sure that the door is locked.</p>

<p>The lift/latch shaft position indicator on the door can be visually inspected to make sure that the door is closed and locked (refer to Aft Passenger Door).</p>
