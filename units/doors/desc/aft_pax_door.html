<p><strong>Aft Passenger Door</strong></p>


<p>This door rotates outwards about the two hinges (main and secondary). A stabilizer rod prevents the yawing movement of the door during opening and closing. Door pressurization loads are carried by 12 stops that engage with their related stop brackets on the door surround structure. In unpressurized flight, the door is prevented from sliding upward by the cam rollers on each side of the lift/latch shaft.</p>

<p>If one cam roller assembly fails, the remaining cam rollers prevent the door from sliding. The lift/latch shaft is secured in the closed position by both the handle lock mechanism and overâˆ’center springs.</p>

<p>As an optional configuration the aft passenger door is provided with an aft entry folding stairway. The aft entry folding stairway is used as the second entry door stairs for the entry and exit of passengers.</p>
