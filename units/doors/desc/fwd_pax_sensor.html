<p><strong>Forward Passenger Door Monitoring</strong></p>


<p>The position of the forward passenger door is monitored by two proximity sensors.</p>

<p>One sensor is located on the top aft side of the door, to verify that the door is closed by making sure that the door is fully down. The other is located adjacent to the door seal pressurizing valve and verifies that the door is locked, when the door closing mechanism is fully overcentred and in safety.</p>

<p>The forward passenger door can be visually inspected to make sure it is closed and locked, by viewing the position of the internal handle. If the door is not locked, the pressurization door seal will not inflate.</p>
