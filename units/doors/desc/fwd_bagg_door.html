<p><strong>Forward Baggage Door</strong></p>


<p>The forward baggage door is unlocked by the operation of an external tee handle. The door opens or closes with the door face parallel with the fuselage skin. This is done by two hinges (main and secondary) and a stabilizer.</p>

<p>Proximity sensors monitor the position of the upper fixed rollers and the door handle. A red warning light comes on in the flight compartment when the door is open or unlocked. The door warning system monitors door status and supplies visual indication and warning in the flight compartment.</p>
