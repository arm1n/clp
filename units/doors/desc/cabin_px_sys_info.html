<p><strong>Door Warning System Input to the Pressurization System</strong></p>

<p>When the aircraft is on the ground, weight on wheels, and all the doors are closed and locked, the CPC starts normal ground sequences. When a door is open or unlocked, the CPC starts a door open sequence, which PREVENTS automatic pressurization.</p>

	
	<p><clp-info-blue><clp-img src="./units/icons/caution.svg" width="25" icon ></clp-img> <b>Manual pressurization is still available.</b></clp-info-blue></p>

<p>If the memorized signal indicates that the doors are closed and locked, the CPC starts the normal flight operational sequence regardless of the door position signal during flight. A door open signal during flight will not affect the CPCS.</p>

<p>If the memorized signal indicates that the doors are not closed and locked, the CPC will start the door open operational sequence regardless of door position signals during flight. Cabin pressurization will not take place when the CPCS is in the automatic mode.</p>

<p><clp-text-blue><strong>NOTE:</strong> Discrete inputs to the CPC are continuously monitored by the CPC when the AUTOMATIC mode is engaged.</clp-text-blue></p>

<p>On aircraft with SB84−32−66 or ModSum 4−126420 incorporated cabin pressurization inhibit to exclude translating doors which are equipped with vent panels.</p>
