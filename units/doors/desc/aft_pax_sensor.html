<p><strong>Aft Passenger Door Monitoring</strong></p>


<p>The position of the aft passenger door is monitored by two proximity sensors. One sensor is located at the aft upper roller guide and make sure that the door is closed. The other sensor is located at the door handle and make sure that the door is locked. </p>

<p>The locking mechanism of the aft passenger door can be inspected to make sure that the door is closed and locked. The door can also be checked to be in the locked position, by seeing that the handle mechanism is pushed fully outward and the vent door is closed, or by checking the lift/latch shaft position indicator on the door.</p>

<p>The location of the two proximity sensors for the aft passenger door is similar to that of the aft service and forward baggage doors.</p>

<br>
<p>If you open the door from the outside or inside of the aircraft generate the following conditions in the flight compartment:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The master <b>WARNING</b> light on the pilotâ€™s glareshield panel flashes continuously</li>
	<li>At the same time the audio <b>CHIME</b> will come on three times</li>
	<li>The <b>FUSELAGE DOORS</b> warning light on the caution and warning panel flashes continuously</li>
	<li>The indication on the door systems page of the Multi Function Display (MFD) changes to a solid red rectangle</li>
</ul>
