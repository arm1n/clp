<p><strong>Valve, Controlâˆ’Door Seal</strong></p>


<p>The door seal pressurization valve operates when the door handle is pushed in and the door is in the locked position. If the door is not fully closed and locked, the pressurization valve will not inflate the seal. The valve deflates the door seal when the door is unlocked by the external handle.</p>
