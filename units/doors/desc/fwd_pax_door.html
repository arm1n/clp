<p><strong>Forward Passenger Door</strong></p>


<p>The forward passenger door is hinged at the bottom and has five steps built into the inboard side of the door structure. The steps also strengthen the door. This door has an external aluminum alloy skin braced by cross beams and intercostals. Door pressurization loads are carried by ten adjustable pressure stop bolts, five on each side. The stop bolts engage with stop brackets on the door surround structure. The door pressure seal inflates to prevent air leakage.</p>

<p>The forward passenger door is the semi−plug type. On opening, the initial movement of the door is upward and inward. The door then rotates outward about the door’s hinge.</p>
