<p><strong>Check Valve, Heated</strong></p>


<p>The valve allows airframe deicing pressure to flow to the door seal system and prevents reverse flow of air, back to the deicing system. The valve is electrically heated to prevent moisture, which may be in the deicing air supply, from freezing inside the valve. </p>

<p>The Timer Monitor Unit (TMU) of the deicing system controls the heater, with inputs from Static Air Temperature sensors 1 and 2. If both SAT sensors indicate that the temperature is greater than 9 °C, the heater is deactivated. The heater is activated when one SAT sensor indicates that the temperature is less than 5 °C. Failure of the heater or failure to activate the heater is detected by the TMU and the DEICE TIMER caution light comes on.</p>
