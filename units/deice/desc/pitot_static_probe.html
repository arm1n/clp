<p><strong>Pitot-Static Probes</strong></p>

<p>Each pitot-static probe has an internal heater element for anti-ice protection. 
Pitot-static heater power is routed through (and monitored by) the TMU.
The TMU senses a defective pitot/static heater and sends the fault code to 
the Air Data Units (ADU).</p>

<p>Heater failures are also recorded by the TMU for 
maintenance purposes. They are sent to the Central Diagnostic System 
(CDS) for display on the appropriate maintenance page of the Aircraft Radio 
Con- trol Display Unit (ARCDU). Failures of the monitoring modules are also 
recorded and correspond to a different message.A pitot-static probe failure detected due to the heating not being selected 
is not recorded as a fault for maintenance.</p>

<p>The No.1 and 2 probes are energized with <b>115 Vac</b> from their related left and right variable requency busses. The Standby Pitot-Static probe is energized from the <b>28 Vdc</b> Right Essential Bus.</p>


<p>The two primary pitotâˆ’static probes are designed to accurately sense pitot and static pressures over the complete operating range of the aircraft</p>
