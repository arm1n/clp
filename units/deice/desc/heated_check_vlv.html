<p><strong>Heated Check Valve (HCV)</strong></p>

<p>The Heated Check Valve (HCV) lets air flow into the aft part 
of the de−icing system. It prevents air from flowing back to the
 wing system in the event of a failure upstream of the Check 
Valve (CV).</p>

<p>This will ensure that the tail is still correctly de−iced 
when a failure occurs in one side of the wing system. 
In the event that one HCV fails open, the tail system is still 
operational.</p>

<p>If one HCV fails closed it will not prevent the tail
 system from operating normally, but the other DDV is no longer 
supplied with pneumatic supply and the tail section is not 
completely de−iced. If the second HCV fails closed air would no
longer be supplied to the tail section.</p>
