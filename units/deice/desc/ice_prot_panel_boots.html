<p>
The AIRFRAME MODE SELECT switch selects the operational 
mode: <strong>MAN, OFF, SLOW, FAST.</strong>
Two automatic modes are available: SLOW and FAST. When the 
SLOW mode is set, the de−ice sequence lasts 183 ±2.5 seconds. 
If the FAST mode is set, the de−ice sequence lasts 63 ±2.5 
seconds.</p>

<div><strong>Selector, Airframe Manual</strong></div>
<p>
For manual operation, the AIRFRAME MODE SELECT switch is 
set to MAN or OFF position and AIRFRAME MANUAL SELECT knob 
is rotated to any of the six positions. This activates the Dual 
Distributing Valves (DDVs) individually, allowing inflation of the 
related boots.

<div><strong>Switch, Boot Air</strong></div>
<p>
The BOOT AIR ISO switch commands the Isolator Shut−off Valve 
(ISOV) to close in order to isolate the left from the right side of 
the system. An example of a situation in which this may be 
required is a pipe burst on one side of the aircraft.</p>
