<p><strong>Air Intake Heater Thermostats</strong></p>

<p>The thermostat is a thermal/mechanical switch. It is energized closed when the Outside Air Temperature (OAT) is decreasing through 60 ±4 F (15±2 C) ando pens when the OAT is increasing 2 to 5 F(1 to 3 C) above 60±4 F (15±2 C).Both thermostats (one for each adaptor) are located on a plate
attached to the skin below the pilot's seat. Transfer tape is used to bond the thermostats to the inside surface of the fuselage skin.

<p>The thermostat is a thermal and mechanical switch which is energized closed when the Outside Air Temperature (OAT) is 60 ±4 °F (15 ±2 °C) and opens when the Outside Air Temperature (OAT) is 2 to 5 °F (1 to 3 °C) above 60 ±4 °F (15 ±2 °C).</p>
