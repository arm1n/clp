<br>
<p>When the windshield control is in the OFF position, the deactivation relay is controlled using the Overheat Temperature Sensor. 
The activation relay stays open regardless of the Normal Temperature Sensor information.</p>

<p>In the WARM−UP or NORM modes, the Anti−Ice Controller (AIC) uses the Normal Temperature Sensor information to control the activation relay and the Overheat Temperature Sensor to control the deactivation relay. </p>

<p>When the pilot’s or copilot’s windshield temperature is less than 93 ±6 °F (34 ±2 °C) or the pilot’s side window temperature is less than 86 ±11 °F (30 ±2 °C), the related Anti−Ice Controller (AIC) activates the related activation relay that supplies 115 Vac to the heater.<br>
When the windshield temperature is above 108 ±6 °F (42 ±3 °C) or the pilot side window temperature is above 101 ±7 °F (38 ±4 °C), the AIC deactivates the deactivation relay which opens the circuit and shuts off the power to the heater. The overheat relays fail (unpowered) in the open position to prevent overheat.</p>
