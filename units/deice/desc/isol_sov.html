<p><strong>Isolation Shut-off Valve (ISOV)</strong></p>

<p>The Isolation Shut-off Valve (ISOV) is normally closed when 
not energized.When an engine is started,it is energized and then 
opens automatically.In the event of a loss of pressure in the 
system, it may be closed by the flight crew to isolate the two 
sides. Isolation is electrically commanded using the BOOT 
AIR ISO switch on the ICE PROTECTION control panel.</p>

<p>A failure of the ISOV (fails open) does not prevent the system 
from operating normally. If a duct ruptures, and the ISOV `has 
failed open, this will cause the loss of air supply. If the two sides 
of the system cannot be isolated, this combination of failures 
would lead to a total loss of airframe de-icing including the 
empennage.</p>
