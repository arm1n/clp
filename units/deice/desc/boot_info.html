<p>The airframe deicing system uses engine bleed air to operate a series of inflatable/deflatable boots. The inflating and deflating action of the boots removes the accumulation of ice on the leading edges of the aircraft.</p>

<p>Nineteen pneumatically inflatable rubber deâˆ’icing boots are bonded to the airframe structure on the wing and tail leading edges. Rubber blankets (boots) cover the area where ice accumulation is anticipated. Within these boots are narrow tubes that can be inflated with compressed air.</p>

<p>The cyclic inflation of these tubes breaks and lifts the ice, which is carried away by the airstream.</p>
