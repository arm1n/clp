<div><strong>Windshield Heat Selector:</strong></div>
<p>
The windshield mode selector labelled WINDSHIELD HEAT OFF/WARM UP/NORM 
on the WINDSHIELD panel operates the pilot and copilot windshield heaters.</p>


<p>The WARM UP mode prevents thermal shocks to the windshield. To avoid this damage, the warm up relay decreases the electrical power supply to the windshield heaters by 50%. This is achieved when the WARM UP mode activates the warm−up relay which places both windshields in a serial connection. When the WARM UP mode is selected, each Anti−Ice Controller (AIC) uses the normal 
temperature sensor information to activate its related windshield heater.</p>

<p>When the NORM mode is selected, both windshields are heated with full electrical power, the WARM UP relay is deactivated and switches from a serial connection to an independent connection on the related bus.</p>

<p>An overheat condition of the pilot’s or copilot’s windshield is shown by the <clp-text-orange><b>WSHLD HOT</b></clp-text-orange> caution light coming on.</p>

<div><b>Pilot Side Window Switch:</b></div>

<p>The side window toggle switch labelled PLT SIDE WDO/HTon the WINDSHIELD wiper control panel operates the pilot’s side window heater. When ON is selected, the right Anti−Ice Controller (AIC) energizes the side window relay, which supplies the pilot’s side window heater with 115 Vac phase A power.</p>

<p>An overheat condition for the pilot side window is shown by the <clp-text-orange><b>SIDE WDO HOT</b></clp-text-orange> caution light coming on.</p>
