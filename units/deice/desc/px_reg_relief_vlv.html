<p><strong>Pressure Regulating, Relief Valves and Non-heatedÂ 
Check Valves</strong></p>

<p>Each pneumatic deice subsystem is supplied with bleed air from 
its respective engine. The Pressure Regulating and Relief Valve 
(PRRV) regulates the pressure according to the bleed flow and 
provides regulated air supply to the system. Pressure regulation 
is done using a diaphragm which opens or 
closes to provide the deicing system with a constant pressure. 
In the event of overpressure in the system, the relief port will 
allow the pressure to decrease.</p>

<p>A failure of one PRRV does not prevent the system 
from operating normally. Failure of both PRRV causes 
total loss of the pneumatic supply and airframe 
deicing.
</p>

<p>The Non-Heated Check Valves (NHCV) prevents air 
from the other system from flowing back into the 
engine system in the event of anengine failure. 
A faulty NHCV does not prevent the deicing system 
from functioning if the two engines are running.</p>
