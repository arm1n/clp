<p><strong>Automatic Drain Valves</strong></p>

<p>The Automatic Drain Valves (ADV) collect water that 
has condensed in the system.The valve drains the 
water when the pressure in the system is below 
3 psig (20.7 kPag) at engine shutdown.</p>

<p>When 
pressure in the system is above 3 psig (20.7 kPag), 
the valve closes to avoid leakage.The ADV is heated 
to prevent trapped water from freezing and 
restricting flow.Two are located in the tail and one 
in each wing upstream of the two DDV.</p>
