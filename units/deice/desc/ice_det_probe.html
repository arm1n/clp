<p><strong>Ice Detector Probes (IDP)</strong></p>

<br>
<p>Each Ice Detector Probe (IDP) is attached to the skin from the outside using 
six bolts. The system advises the flight crew of icing conditions when ice accu-
mulation is greater than 0.02 in (0.5 mm) on the probe.</p>

<p>The electro-thermal deicing heater dissipates 300 W when supplied with 115 Vac.The deicing heater can deice the entire probe and all parts exposed to the airflow in less than 15 seconds. 
In cases of very severe icing conditions, when the entire 
probe is not completely deiced after 45 ±4 seconds, the heater cycles off and 
on. If the sensor temperature exceeds 140 ±9 F (60 ±5 C) the deicing heater 
stops, and will be started again when the temperature is below the overheat 
threshold. This protects the sensor's internal parts from damage due to 
overheating.</p>

<p><clp-text-orange><b>Failure</b></clp-text-orange> of both Ice Detection Probes (IDP) causes the <clp-text-orange><b>ICE DETECT FAIL</b></clp-text-orange> caution light to come on. Failure of one IDP is reported to the TMU. The TMU stores the 
failure as a maintenance message that will be displayed on the Engine Systems 
Integrated Display (ESID) when the Centralized Diagnostic System (CDS) is 
interrogated. The displayed message is <clp-text-orange><b>“LEFT IDP FAIL”</b></clp-text-orange> or 
<clp-text-orange><b>“RIGHT IDP FAIL”</b></clp-text-orange> for the related left or right IDP failure.</p>
