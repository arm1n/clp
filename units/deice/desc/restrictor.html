<p><strong>Restrictor</strong></p>

<p>The restrictor lets air flow from one side of the aft system to 
the other side. </p>

<p>It provides the necessary communication between the two parts 
of the system to ensure that the tail is correctly de−iced in 
the event of a failure upstream of one of the Heated Check 
Valves (HCVs).</p>

<p>It also reduces the amount 
of air loss in case of a failure downstream of one of the HCVs, 
which allows partial de−icing of the tail.</p>
