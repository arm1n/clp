<p><strong>Static Temperature Probe</strong></p>

<p>The Engine Display (ED) shows the Static Air Temperature (SAT) digital 
display in white digits with a + or − symbol and a °C label to the right of 
the digits. The ED shows SAT from ADC1. When an EFIS ADC SOURCE is 
set to 2, theED will show the SAT parameter from ADC2</p>

<p>The static 
temperature probe is attached flush to an access panel in the wing to 
fuselage fairing below the left wing root with four mounting screws. The 
probe has two isolated platinum temperature sensing elements that have 
an 0 C base resistance of 500 ohms, and a thermal coefficient of resistance 
of 0.00385 ohms/degree C. The accuracy of the resistance over the -50 
to +50 C range is ± 1 ohm. This resistance error is equivalent to a 
temperature accuracy of 0.52 C within this range. The static temperature 
probe measures the surrounding aircraft Indicated Outside Air Temperature 
(IOAT). </p>

<p>It is a flush-attached electrical resistance transmitter with temperature resistance properties. The IOAT measured by the sensors are 
affected by airspeed. A recovery factor, (a value programmed in the ADC 
to change IOAT data to SAT) is stored in each ADC and is used to calculate 
from IOAT the Static Air Temperature (SAT) and the True Air Temperature 
(TAT). The static temperature probe measures the surrounding aircraft 
Indicated Outside Air Temperature (IOAT). It is a flush−attached electrical 
resistance transmitter with temperature resistance properties. The IOAT 
measured by the two sensors is affected by airspeed, a recoveryfactor, 
(a value programmed into the ADC to change IOAT data to SAT) is storedin 
each ADC and is used to calculate from IOAT the Static Air Temperature
(SAT) and the True Air Temperature (TAT).</p>

flight conditions by attaching cooling packs on sensor area.</clp-text-blue>
