<p><strong>Angle of Attack (AOA)</strong></p>

<p>The Angle of Attack (AOA1, AOA2) Transducer is used to measure the local angle of attack. Each AOA transducer has a fixed body that is attached to the aircraft and a transducer that is moved by the relative airflow. The Angle of Attack (AOA1, AOA2) Transducer is used to measure the local 
angle of attack.</p>

<p>The transducer is connected to a shaft that turns freely. A counterweight and a damper are attached to the shaft to balance the transducer. The damper is used to reduce interference and wear on the movable parts. </p>

<p>The AOA transducer has two resolvers to send angular data to the Stall Protection Modules (SPM1, SPM2). Each resolver uses 7 Vac, 2500 Hz excitation power. The AOA transducer has a self-regulated heater to prevent icing. The body is not heated.</p>
