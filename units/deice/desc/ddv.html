<p><strong>Dual Distributing Valve (DDV)</strong></p>

<p>The DDV is supplied with air from the system and distributes it 
to the boots through two separate electrical valves. 
Each valve is commanded separately, one after the other, 
according to timer sequencing or manual operation.
The Low Pressure Switch (LPS) incorporated on each DDV 
output closes when the pressure rises above 15 ± 1 psig 
(103.4 ±6.89 kPa) at boot inflationwhich sends a signal to the 
Timer and Monitor Unit (TMU).</p>

<p>This signal is used to confirm that the commanded valve has 
opened normally and that pressure was sufficient to inflate the 
boots normally. At boot deflation, the electrical valve allows air to 
flow back to the DDV and to exhaust the system through the 
ejector. The LPS opens when pressure is less than 11 +2.5/−1 
 (75.8 ±17.2/−6.89 kPa) indicating to the timer that the 
commanded valve has operated normally.</p>

<p>Air from the boots is removed using a venturi effect. 
This allows the boots to flatten on the leading edge when they
 are not inflated. The Dual Distributing Valve (DDV) is heated to 
prevent the electrical valves and the ejector from freezing and 
to avoid moisture on the connector.</p>
