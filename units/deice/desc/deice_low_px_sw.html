<p><strong>Switches, Low Pressure Warning</strong></p>

<p>The Low Pressure Warning Switch (LPWS) senses low pressure in the system. The LPWS is closed when the pressure inside the system is below 15 ±1 psig (103.4 ±6.89 kPa) and opens when the pressure exceeds 12.5 psig (86.2 kPa).</p>

<p>When the LPWS is closed, it sends signals to the Caution and Warning Panel to illuminate the <b>DEICE PRESS</b> caution light. The LPWS signal is also sent to the Timer and Monitor Unit (TMU) for maintenance purposes.</p>

<p>Two LPWS’s are installed in front of the front spar, in the wing to body fairing area.</p>
