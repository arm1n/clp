<p><strong>Control-Propeller Heater Switch</strong></p>

<br>
<p>A rotary switch labeled <b>PROPâˆ’TEST/OFF/ON,</b> located in the flight 
compartment on the overhead panel, controls the power to the heater. </p>

<p>In the <b>TEST</b> position, the propellers are cycled through one time for a 
period of 5 seconds each. The test cannot be initialized again for 30 
seconds to prevent overheating of the blade elements when the aircraft is on the ground.</p>

<p>The propeller speed (Np) must be greater than <b>400 rpm</b> for the test function to operate.Two advisory lights, one for each propeller, 
are located on the ICE PROTECTION control panel and indicate propeller 
heater function to the flight crew.</p>
