<p><strong>REF SPEEDS switch on the ICE PROTECTION PANEL</strong></p>

<br>
<p>When the aircraft is in icing conditions, the lift supplied by the wings can be decreased enough to cause the aircraft to stall at a lower angle of attack. The stall operating angle of the stick shaker and stick pusher is set to a relatively lower angle of attack when in icing conditions. The Stall Protection System (SPS) receives icing condition status data from the selection of the propeller anti-ice switch. On aircraft with Mod 4Q126089, the Stall Protection System (SPS) receives icing condition status data from the selection of the INCR position of the REF SPEEDS switch on the ICE PROTECTION panel.</p>

<p>The Propeller De-Icing Switch supplies a discrete signal to the two SPMs. The SPS will use one de-icing selected status discrete or the other to calculate the operating angle.
