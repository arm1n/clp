<p><strong>Ambient Pressure Sensor:</strong></p>

<p>The sensor is located at the left side of the APU.</p>

<p>The sensor supplies ambient pressure information to the FADEC prior to start. This information is used for altitude compensation of the fuel during start and operation of the APU.</p>

<p>A loss of the ambient pressure signal results in an advisory fault and the FADEC will default to sea level ambient pressure.</p>
