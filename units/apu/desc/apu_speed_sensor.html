<p><strong>Speed Sensor:</strong></p>

<p>The sensor is installed to the air inlet housing.</p>

<p>The sensor is a single-probe, dual coil device. The magnetic probe extends through the air inlet housing and aligns with the lobes on the quill shaft.</p>

<p>The dual coils give redundant speed signals to the FADEC and used for start sequencing and speed sensing (overspeed and underspeed). The two signals are averaged by FADEC to give the rated speed.</p>

<p>Failure of one signal will result in an advisory fault. Loss of both signals will cause an automatic APU shutdown.</p>
