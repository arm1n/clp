<p><strong>Fuel Filter Element:</strong></p>

<p>The filter is a full flow type with a replaceable 10−micron filter element.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Fuel Filter Assembly:</b></p>
<p>The low−pressure fuel filter protects the fuel control from contamination.</p>

<p>The filter differential pressure indicator and bypass valve are located on 
the side of the filter housing. The impending bypass indicator gives a 
visual warning when fuel flow through the filter becomes restricted and 
a pressure differential of 1 to 2 psid occurs.
</p>

<p>The filter bypass valve will open at a pressure differential of 7 psid to 
let fuel bypass the filter and maintain flow through the system.</p>
