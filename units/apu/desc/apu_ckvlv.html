<p><strong>APU CHECK VALVE</strong></p>

<p>The APU check valve is a dual flapper, spring loaded check valve. The valve is installed in line with the APU bleed air ducting in the aft fuselage. It is held open by bleed air coming from the APU. It allows bleed air to flow to the air conditioning pack but prevents reverse flow to the APU from the engine bleed air system.</p>
