<p><strong>Magnetic Drain Plug:</strong></p>

<p>A magnetic drain plug is located on the lower, front side of the gearbox housing.</p>

<p>When the plug is removed, oil is drained from the oil sump. The drain plug has a magnetic chip detector that attracts ferrous metal particles in the oil.</p>

<p>The detector may be removed, inspected, and installed without draining the oil sump.
A check valve located inside the drain plug prevents oil from draining when the chip detector is removed.</p>
