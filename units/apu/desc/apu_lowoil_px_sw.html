<p><strong>Low Oil Pressure Switch:</strong></p>

<p>The switch is located on the forward face of the gearbox assembly and senses oil 
pressure, downstream of the oil filter.</p>

<p>The normally closed switch opens when oil pressure exceeds 35 psig (241 kPag), 
the switch will close when oil pressure decreases below this value during APU 
operation.</p>

<p>An open switch prior to start (failed switch), or a closed switch during operation 
(failed switch or low pressure) will result in the FADEC automatically shutting 
down the APU.</p>
