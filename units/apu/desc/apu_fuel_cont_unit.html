<p><strong>Fuel Control Unit:</strong></p>

<p>The electronic fuel control assembly is located on the fuel pump. The assembly contains a fuel servo valve and a differential pressure valve.</p>

<p>The servo valve is energized open at start up. The fuel servo receives 
milliamp signals from the FADEC to maintain 100% Ng speed during all 
APU load conditions.</p>


<p>In the shutdown sequence FADEC maintains current to the fuel servo valve and deâˆ’energizes the valve.</p>
