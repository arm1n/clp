<p><strong>Gearbox Cooling Duct:</strong></p>

<p>Ambient air enters the tailcone through a 4 inch diameter cutout. 
This is located at the bottom centerline of the tailcone between the 
firewall and the access door. The cutout is protected by a stainless 
steel 1/4 inch mesh screen.</p>


<p>The air is ducted from the cutout by a tube to the area immediately 
in front of the oil sump to assist in oil cooling. The air then flows 
around the APU and finally it is educted into the ejector gas flow.</p>
