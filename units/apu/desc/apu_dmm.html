<p><strong>Data Memory Module:</strong></p>

<p>Two ignitor plugs are installed, one on the left side and one on the right side of the engine.</p>

<p>The Data Memory Module (DMM) is a solid state device located on the 
engine assembly. The DMM contains a mirror image of the data contained 
in the non−volatile memory (NVM) within the FADEC.</p>

<div>Data stored in the DMM includes:</div>
<ul>
	<li>APU operating hours and starts</li>
	<li>APU and FADEC fault history, 50 shutdown and 50</li>
	<li>FADEC, APU and DMM serial numbers</li>
	
</ul>

<br>
<p>FADEC updates the DMM at the same time the data is updated in the FADEC NVM. <br> This feature enables hours/cycles and fault history to be resident on the engine assembly. </p>


<p>Should the FADEC or DMM be replaced on−wing, the data is automatically 
copied to the newly replaced item, controlled by software without technician 
intervention.</p>
