<p><b>APU FUEL SYSTEM SCHEMATIC</b></p>
<p>The gearbox driven fuel control receives fuel from the aircraft fuel system. Fuel flows through the low pressure centrifugal fuel pump to the fuel/oil cooler, fuel filter, high pressure fuel pump, the fuel servo valve and to the fuel solenoid manifold assembly. Excess fuel is circulated through the relief valve across the high pressure fuel pump. A differential pressure valve is in parallel with the fuel servo valve to maintain a constant differential pressure across the fuel servo valve.</p>

<p>This results in a fuel flow linear relationship to the servo current command from the Full Authority Digital Electronic Control (FADEC).The FADEC controlled fuel flow provides efficient starting and operation of the APU.The start sequence begins with the servo valve energized open at start up.</p>

<p>The start fuel valve is energized open at 3% gas generator (Ng) speed and fuel flows to the two start nozzles and is ignited by the ignitors. When 25% Ng speed is reached the main fuel valve is energized open and fuel flows to six additional main fuel nozzles. A flow divider valve that is located in the fuel solenoid manifold assembly opens when fuel pressure reaches 300 psid (2068.4 kPad). The valve makes sure proper fuel pressure is maintained to the start nozzles.The start fuel valve stays open to 70% Ng speed and then is deâˆ’energized closed. At this time, the start fuel check valve, located down stream of the start fuel valve, opens to remove residual fuel from the Start Fuel manifold and nozzles. The start fuel check valve is opened by APU compressor air pressure (PCD) when fuel pressure is no longer present. The valve gives a continuous PCD air flow through the nozzles during APU operation.</p>
