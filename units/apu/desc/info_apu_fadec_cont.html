<p><strong>APU Full Authority Digital Electronic Control (FADEC)</strong></p>

<p>The Full Authority Digital Electronic Controller (FADEC) is a microprocessor based controller. The FADEC has the necessary functions for control sequencing, condition monitoring, fault detection, fault isolation and protection of the APU system. The FADEC also transmits fault and maintenance data to the aircraft Centralized Diagnostic System (CDS) through the ARINC 429 data link. This data is used to provide APU maintenance information.</p>
