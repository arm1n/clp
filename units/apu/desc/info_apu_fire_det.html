<p><strong>Advanced Pneumatic Detector (APD)</strong></p>

<p>The APD receives electrical power from the right essential bus. Two switches (integrity and alarm) are integral in the APD. They show the APU compartment fire or overheat conditions on the Fire Protection Panel (FPP).</p>

<p>The integrity switch monitors the pressure in the sensor element. If an APD breaks, the loss of pressure will open the integrity switch and signal the control amplifier to turn on the FAULT light on the FPP. The alarm switch is normally open, and closes when an overheat or fire condition occurs, caused by the pressure increase in the APD.</p>

<p>The alarm switch directly signals the FIRE advisory light on the FPP. The FIRE (red) advisory light remains on steady state for the duration of the alarm. The alarm signals are also processed by the control amplifier and then sent to the FPP.</p>
