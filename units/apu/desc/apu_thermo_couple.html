<p><strong>Thermocouple:</strong></p>

<p>The two single−element, closed end, chromel/alumel thermocouples are located on the APU exhaust flange and extend into the exhaust gas stream.</p>

<p>The thermocouples are installed 90 degrees apart, at the five and eight o’clock positions and supply millivolt signals that are used by FADEC for exhaust gas temperature sensing.</p>

<p>The FADEC averages the two signals to give the exhaust gas temperature. An open or short failure of one thermocouple will result in an advisory message. Failure of both thermocouples will cause an APU shutdown.</p>
