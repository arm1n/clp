<p>Two ignitor plugs are installed, one on the left side and one on the right side of the engine.</p>

The 10 milllimeter, gap type ignitors give a high voltage intermittent 
spark that ignites the fuelâˆ’air mixture in the combustor.</p>

<p>The ignitors are connected to the Ignition Exciter by two separate 
shielded ignition cables.</p>
