<p><strong>Exhaust:</strong></p>

<p>The APU exhaust system vents the exhaust gases from the APU 
to the environment, and the ventilation system cools the APU.</p>


<p>The APU exhaust nozzle and the silenced exhaust duct are not 
connected but arranged to form an ejector system. 
The exhaust gas is discharged from the duct through an 
upwards pointing outlet at the aft end of the duct.</p>
