<p><strong>Combiner</strong></p>


<p>Contains the Combiner Optical Element (COE) which optically combines displayed flight symbology with the pilot's view through the aircraft windshield.</p>

<p>This permits the various symbols, like the Zero-Degree Pitch Line, to overlay the corresponding features of the outside world.</p>

<p>The Combiner displays the flight symbology at optical infinity, allowing the pilot to see the information without a shift in eye focus.</p>
