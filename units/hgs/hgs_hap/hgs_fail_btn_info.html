<p>To turn the annunciation light off, push the pushbutton. It will not turn back on until ARINC data returns to normal and another failure is detected. <br>
This annunciation is enabled when the HGS is in AIII mode, below 500 feet AGL and in the air; and in TO mode when the ground speed is between 40 and 80 knots.
