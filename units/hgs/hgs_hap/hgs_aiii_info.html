<p>Indicates that the HGS is operating in AIII mode and there are no AIII capability 
or approach monitor faults. <br>
It is displayed concurrently with the AIII mode annunciation on the Combiner.</p>

<p><strong>Alll Mode Requirements and Conditions</strong></p>

<p>Approach capture logic is definedas Aircraft On Course(AOC) and dependson these criteria:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The FGS captures the glideslope</li>
	<li>The FGS captures the localizer</li>
	<li>The difference between the aircraft's magnetic track and the selected course is less than 30Â°</li>
	<li>Aircraft altitude is greater than 500 feet AGL</li>
	<li>The IRS is in NAV mode</li>
	<li>The EFIS ATT/HDG and ADC SOURCE switches are set to NORM</li>
	<li>ILS1 is the left pilot's active NAV source</li>
	<li>ILS2 is the right pilot's active NAV source</li>
	<li>Both barometric altimeters agree within 50 feet</li>
	<li>Both barometric altimeters agree within 50 fee</li>
	<li>The HCP runway elevation is set</li>
	<li>The HCP reference glideslope is set. The limits are -2.50 to -3.00 degrees</li>
	<li>The HCP runway length is set for Rollout mode</li>
</ul>



<p>Once aircraft systems and flight conditions satisfy AOC for an approach, deviating outside 
AOC tolerances will not cause the HGS to lose AIII capability. However, AIII capability maybe
lost due to abnormal conditions based on the invalid state of a required system or an 
out-of-tolerance condition detected as a function of HGS approach monitoring.</p>
