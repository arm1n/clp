<p><strong>HGS Annunciator Panel (HAP)</strong></p>

<p>The HGS Annunciator Panel (HAP) is a low-profile, surface mount panel that provides eleven annunciations that allow the first officer to monitor HGS operation.</p>

<p>The HAP is connected to the aircraftâ€™s CAUT/ADVSY and BRT/DIM test switches. The BRT input from the BRT/DIM switch momentarily goes to 28 Vdc to put the HAP in bright mode. </p>

<p>The DIM input from the BRT/DIM switch momentarily goes to 28 Vdc to put the HAP in dim mode. When the switch is in the ADVSY position, all the HAP LEDs turn on and remain on while the switch remains in the ADVSY position.
	(Pushing the TEST pushbutton on the HCP also starts a 5-second HAP LED test.)</p>

<p>BITE in the HAP ensures that the HAP is operating correctly. A no fault condition results in a ground on the BITE connection between the HAP and Computer. An open on this line indicates a fault. When the Test mode is active, fault
	codes are displayed on the HCP and on the Existing Faults page available on the
	Maintenance Menu.</p>
