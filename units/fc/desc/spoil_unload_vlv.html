<p><strong>Spoiler Unload Valves</strong></p>

<p>The No.1 unload valve is located on the left side of the fuselage in the wing root area. 
The No.2 unload valve is located on the right side of the fuselage also in the wing root area. 
The No.1 unload valve controls both inboard spoiler PCU's, and the NO.2 unload valve controls both outboard spoiler PCU's.</p>

<p>In Flight Mode, the No.2 unload valve is operated electrically through the Flight Control Electronic Control Unit (FCECU), to prevent extension of the outboard spoilers when aircraft airspeed is above 170 kt. The No.2 unload valve can also be operated by depressing the roll spoiler switchlight SPLR 2 PUSH OFF. If the inboard spoiler PCU linkage jams, the No. 1 unload valve will prevent extension of the inboard spoilers when the SPLR 1 PUSHOFF switchlight is pushed. The unload valves can be energized by selecting the FLIGHT/TAXI switch to TAXI.</p>
