<p><strong>PITCH FEEL ACTUATOR</strong></p>


<p>The input commands from the control columns are transferred to the elevator PCUs which, in turn, move the elevator surfaces. Therefore the pilot is unable to feel the aerodynamic forces acting on the elevator surfaces. The Pitch Feel and Trim Units (PFTUs) supply elevator control column forces which increase with column displacement as a function of airspeed and normal acceleration of the aircraft.</p>

<p>Air Data Units (ADUs) send airspeed information to the FCECU. Artificial feel is produced by two pitch feel actuators attached to the PFTUs. As airspeed increases or decreases, the FCECU commands the pitch feel actuators to extend or retract respectively. This results in an increase or decrease in the amount of artificial feel acting on the control columns.</p>

<p>If one pitch feel actuator fails, the elevator control system continues to operate using the operational actuator but with reduced artificial feel ELEVATOR FEEL caution light comes on when there is a disagreement between the two elevator feel units.</p>
