<p><strong>Transmission Shaft</strong></p>

<p>The transmission shaft system transmits the mechanical power from the Flap Power Unit (FPU) to the eight flap actuators. There are 16 transmission shafts located along the aft spars of the wings. Nine shafts extend outward from the FPU along the left wing aft spar to engage with each of the four flap actuators on the left wing. Seven shafts extend outward from the FPU along the right wing aft spar to engage with each of the four flap actuators on the right wing. All 16
transmission shafts are aluminum tube assemblies of different lengths.
</p>

<p>There are two torsion bars installed on the aircraft. Each torsion bar is an aluminum alloy shaft with external splined connections. The two shafts transfer the rotary movement of the FPU to the transmission shafts and actuators on the wings. The two torsion bars transmit a high speed, low torque rotating force from the FPU to the transmission shafts and flap actuators.</p>
