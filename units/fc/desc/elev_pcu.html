<p><strong>ELEVATOR PCU</strong></p>


<p>There are three identical elevator Power Control Units (PCUs) connected to each elevator surface. </p>

<ul>
	<li>The outboard PCUs are powered by the No.1 hydraulic system</li>
	<li>the centre PCUs are powered by the No.2 hydraulic system</li>
	<li>The inboard PCUs are powered by the No.3 standby hydraulic system</li>
</ul>

<p>The outboard and centre elevator PCUs are normally active. The inboard elevator
PCUs are activated only when the No. 1 and/or No. 2 hydraulic systems fail.<br>
Gust protection for the elevators is supplied by trapped hydraulic fluid within the PCUs when the system is depressurized.</p>
