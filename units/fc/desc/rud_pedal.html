<p><strong>RUDDER PEDALS</strong></p>

<p>Movement of the rudder pedals supplies yaw commands to the
rudder control system. The yaw commands are mechanically
transmitted from the pilot's and copilot's rudder pedals to the rudder
surfaces. These commands are transmitted through the Rudder Feel
and Trim Unit and the rudder Power Control Units (PCUs). The
PCUs move the rudder surfaces using hydraulic power.</p>

<p><strong>Rudder Adjustment Pedals</strong></p>

<p>A rudder pedal adjustment handle allows fore and aft adjustment of 
either pair of rudder pedals to accommodate individual pilot preference 
for pedal difference. Each adjustment handle is located on the pedestal 
between the pilot's feet.</p>
