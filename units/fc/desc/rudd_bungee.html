<p><strong>PCU Input Bungee</strong></p>

<p>There are two PCU input bungees, one for each rudder PCU. Each PCU input bungee has a spring strut and a motion detector. Each spring strut is installed between the feel unit assembly and its related PCU summing bar. A spring strut motion detector is installed parallel to each spring strut and has a cam arm, link, and limit switch.</p>

<p>During normal operation, each spring strut length stays constant. Any rotation of the rudder aft quadrant by the pilot is directly transmitted through the spring strut to its related PCU. </p>

<p>In the event of a jam of the PCU or its linkage, any further pilot input to the rudder aft quadrant causes an inner spring in the strut to either stretch or compress. This action either increases or decreases the overall length of the strut. The change in strut length causes the motion detector cam arm to trigger the limit microswitch. When the limit microswitch has been triggered, the applicable RUD 1 or RUD 2 rudder switchlight on the glareshield panel comes on with the inscription, PUSH OFF, to warn of the jammed condition. The switchlight can then be pushed to depressurize the jammed system. The illuminated inscription on the switchlight then changes to OFF to show the pilot that the switch has been pushed.</p>
