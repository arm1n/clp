<p><strong>Spoiler cable sensor</strong></p>

<p>A spoiler cable sensor will automatically retract the spoilers if there is a failure of fuselage spoiler cable.  The spoiler cable sensor-assembly has a roller arm, a tension spring, a latch spring and switches. If the tension of the fuselage spoiler cables decreases to zero, the tension spring will pull the roller arm against a stop. In this position, the end of the roller arm will operate the switches. The normally-open switches are closed. This gives a signal to the inboard and outboard unload valves to close.</p>

<p>The spoiler PCU extend pressure is removed and the hold-down pressure moves all the spoilers to the retracted position.</p>

<p> <strong>Also, the ROLL SPLR INBD HYD and ROLL SPLR OUTBD HYD caution lights will come on. The latch spring will latch the roller arm and keep the spoiler sensor switches in the closed position until it is released by maintenance personnel on the ground.</strong></p>
