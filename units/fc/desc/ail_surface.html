<p><strong>Aileron Surfaces</strong></p>

<p>The aileron surfaces assisted by the roll spoilers give roll (lateral) control of the aircraft in flight.
There are two aileron control surfaces. One is installed on the outboard end of the left wing and the other is installed on the outboard end of the right wing. Each aileron surface forms part of the trailing edge of its respective wing. Each aileron control surface can travel Â±17 degrees around the
neutral position. </p>

<p>At airspeeds above 170 kt (315 km/h), the ailerons and the inboard roll spoilers give sufficient lateral control of the aircraft. At airspeeds below 170 kt (315 km/h), the ailerons are
assisted by both the inboard and the outboard roll spoilers. Each aileron has a geared tab that gives aerodynamic assistance to the movement of the aileron surfaces in flight. The geared tab also
helps to overcome the load put on the control wheels by the torsion bar in the aileron trim and centering unit. A horn with internal mass balance weights is located on the outboard end of each aileron to give aerodynamic balance. Only the right aileron has a ground adjustable trim tab located
inboard of the geared tab. The adjustment is made on the serrated plate, at the tab end of the geared linkage.</p>
