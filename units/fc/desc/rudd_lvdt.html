<p><strong>Rudder Position LVDT</strong></p>

<p>A rudder position LVDT is located in the vertical stabilizer next to the
rudder. It monitors the position of the rudder then transmits the
rudder position data to the Flight Data Recorder (FDR). The rudder
position LVDT also transmits the rudder position data to the Powered
Flight Control Surface Indicator (PFSCI) located on the pilot's Multi
Functional Display (MFD) to display the position of the rudder.</p>
