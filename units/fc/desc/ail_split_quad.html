<p><strong>Aileron Splitter Quadrant</strong></p>

<p>The aileron splitter quadrant transmits aileron cable inputs from the copilot's 
control handwheel to the aileron terminal quadrants located in each wing</p>

<p>Gust locking of the ailerons is supplied by an internal spring-loaded 
lever attached off-center to the bottom of the splitter quadrant. When
the gust lock is engaged a plunger is inserted in the gust lock plate at
the base of the splitter quadrant, locking the ailerons in neutral.</p>
