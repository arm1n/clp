<p><strong>ELEVATOR CENTERING DEVICE</strong></p>


<p>A centering spring is installed in each PCU input torque tube, to assist the springs of the Pitch Feel and Trim Unit. The Pitch Feel and Trim Unit centers the two elevator control circuits after the pilot releases an input command. <br>
When either control column is moved fore or aft, the input command is transmitted through the elevator control circuit to the PCU input torque tube. The tube then rotates in either direction to transmit the input commands to the elevator PCUs. When the PCU input torque tube rotates, a load is placed on the centering spring causing the spring to increase torsion. After the pilot releases the input command, the load exerted by the centering spring causes the control column to return to the neutral position.</p>
