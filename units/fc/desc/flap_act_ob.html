<p><strong>Flap Actuators</strong></p>

<p>There are eight flap actuators installed on the aircraft, four on each wing. The flap actuators are mechanical units designed to a convert high speed, low torque rotary drive to a low speed, high torque linear drive. The flap actuators move the flap surfaces to a selected position and keep the selected position against the aerodynamic forces on the flap surfaces. </p>

<p>The flap actuators receive the mechanical input from the transmission shafts or the torsion bars through a spline connection and transfer this force to the next actuator by a through shaft.
TheNo.1 and No.2 flap actuators on each wing are identical and operate the inboard flap section. 
The No.3 and No.4 flap actuators on each wing are constructed slightly different from each other and operate the outboard flap section.</p>

<p>Each flap actuator includes the components that follow:<br>
- No-back/torque limiter device<br>
- Worm gear<br>
- Recirculating ballscrew</p>
