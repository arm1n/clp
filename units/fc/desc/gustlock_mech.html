<p><strong>Aileron gust lock mechanism</strong></p>

<p>The aileron gust lock mechanism  is located on the aft face of the wing rear spar, right of the aircraftcentreline. The mechanism has a cable-operated gust lock lever, a spring-loaded plunger, two tension springs and a lock plate on the aileron splitter quadrant.</p>

<p>If the ailerons are in the neutral position, the plunger engages in the lock plate slot and prevents the aileron splitter quadrant from rotating. If the ailerons are not in the neutral position, the plunger is compressed against the face of the lock plate. When the ailerons are moved to the neutral position the plunger springs out to the locked position.</p>
