<p>The Linear Variable Differential Transformer (LVDT) is a single channel,
single sensor LVDT. It senses the elevator surface position and
transmits the position data to the Flight Control Electronic Control
Unit (FCECU) and to the Powered Flight Control Surface Indicator
(PFCSI) on the pilots MFD. There are two LVDTs located in the
horizontal stabilizer; one attached to each elevator surface.</p>
