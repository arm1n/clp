<p><strong>Aileron Gust Lock System</strong></p>

<p>The gust lock system locks the aileron control surfaces in the neutral position to protect the aileron surfaces from damage.</p>

<p>When the lever is moved to the ON position, the aileron splitter quadrant is locked in the neutral position and the power levers cannot be advanced. The
ailerons are locked in the neutral position.</p>

<p>If a gust lock cable fails, the gust lock mechanism fails safe to the
unlocked position.</p>
