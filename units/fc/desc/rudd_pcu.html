<p><strong>Power Control Units (PCUs) - <clp-link-popup path="./units/fc/desc/rud_trim_act_details.html" name="115V AC VARIABLE FREQUENCY CB PANEL">Show more Details â†’ </clp-link-popup></strong></p> 


<p>There are two Power Control Units (PCUs), one located above the other in the vertical stabilizer. The No.2 hydraulic system powers the upper PCU while the No.1 hydraulic system powers the lower PCU. Each PCU has a single fully balanced ram and integral hydraulic manifold. A mechanically operated four-way Main Control Valve (MCV) positions the ram. Position feedback is done by a mechanical linkage, which compares the commanded ram position with the actual position.</p>

<p>The Rudder Hinge Moment Limiter System (HML) is a part of each PCU. The HML has a pressure unloading valve, a pressure control valve and two pressure sensors for each PCU. The HML is interfaced with and controlled by the FCECU. During normal operation, the No.1 and No.2 hydraulic systems supply 3000 psi (20684 kPa) of pressure. The HML and FCECU reduce this pressure to 1500 psi (10342 kPa) at each PCU. As airspeed increases, the FCECU and the HML gradually reduce the pressure at each PCU down to a minimum pressure of 600 psi (4137 kPa). Limiting the hydraulic pressure available to the rudder PCUs reduces total rudder travel at higher aircraft speeds.</p>

<p>If either No.1 or No.2 hydraulic systems fails, the FCECU energizes the pressure unloading valve and sets the pressure control valve of the failed system to zero pressure. At the same time, the FCECU increases the pressure to the active PCU to compensate for the loss. The rudder control system continues to operate if one PCU fails.</p>
