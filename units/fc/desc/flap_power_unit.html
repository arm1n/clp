<p><strong>Flap Power (FPU) Unit</strong></p>

<p>The Flap Power Unit (FPU) is located on the wing aft spar, to the right of the aircraft centreline. The FPU
converts aircraft hydraulic power to rotary mechanical power to operate the flap actuators, raising or lowering 
the flaps, as selected.
The FPU has a hydraulic module and a gearbox.</p>

<p>The hydraulic module includes the components that follow:<br>
- Inlet filter<br>
- Solenoid and shut-off valve<br>
- Two-stage Electro-Hydraulic Servo Valve (EHSV)<br>
- Hydraulic motor<br>
- Pressure switch</p>

<p>The gearbox has a two-stage spur reduction geartrain housed in an
aluminum casing.
Hydraulic pressure is supplied from the No. 1 hydraulic system to the
FPU through a filter and a restrictor at the inlet port.</p>
