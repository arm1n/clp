<p>A rudder yaw damper actuator, supplies automatic compensation for
minor rudder deflections to improve directional stability and turn
coordination.The yaw damper actuator works independently or in
conjunction with the Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS). Yaw
damper authority is 4.5 degrees of rudder movement either side of
centre. The yaw damper gets its inputs from Flight Guidance
Modules N0.1 and No.2 and needs both inputs for operation</p>
