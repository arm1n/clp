<p><strong>Flap Surfaces</strong></p>

<p>The flap surfaces extend inboard of the ailerons and aft from the trailing edges of both wings. The flaps give increased lift, when extended, during take off and landing The flaps are selected by the pilot during take-off and landing.</p>

<p>When the flaps are retracted, they fit into the flap shroud along the trailing edge of the wing to form an aerodynamically clean wing surface.</p>

<p>The flap surfaces include the components that follow:<br>
- Flaps, Inboard <br>
