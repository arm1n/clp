<p><strong>Flaps</strong></p>

<p>The wing flaps supply increased lift during take−off and landing.</p>

<p>Each wing has an inboard and an outboard flap surface. The inboard flap on each wing is installed between the fuselage structure and the engine nacelle inboard structure. The outboard flap on each wing is installed between the engine nacelle outboard structure and the aileron (refer to SDS 27–54–00). Indication of flap position is given by an indicator on the copilot’s Multi Function Display.</p>

<p>The flap surfaces are electronically controlled and hydraulically operated. The flaps are extended when the flap lever is moved in its quadrant. The flap quadrant is located in the power quadrant on the right side of the centre console. The flap quadrant has five positions corresponding to the five possible flap positions: 0°, 5 °, 10 °, 15 ° and 35 °.</p>
