<p><strong>RUDDER TRIM PANEL</strong></p>

<p>The trimming system is electrically powered from the Left Essential bus through two circuit breakers; one for the trim actuator and the other for the RUDDER trim indicator.
The amount of rudder trim is shown on the RUDDER trim indicator, on the centre console, in the flight compartment.</p>

<p>Turning the RUDDER trim switch fully to the left (L) or right (R), gives trim at a high rate. When the switch is turned to the first graduation line, a slower trim rate is given. The trim actuator can move the rudder surface a maximum of 10 degrees to the left or right of center.
As the rudder is being trimmed the position is shown on the RUDDER trim indicator.</p>
