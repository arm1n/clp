<p><strong>Rudder Feel and Trim</strong></p>

<p>The rudder feel and trim unit gives artificial feel to the rudder pedals during operation. Because the rudder system is a powered flight control, the unit is used to prevent the pilot from overcontrolling the aircraft in flight.</p>

<p>The rudder trim actuator gives the pilot trim control around the yaw axis of the aircraft in flight. Rudder trimming biases the complete rudder system, so that a newly trimmed position is sensed by the pilot as the neutral position.</p>
