<p><strong>Aileron Geared Tap</strong></p>

<p>Each aileron has a geared tab, which gives aerodynamic assistance to movement 
of the aileron control surface.</p>

<p>The aileron geared tab is attached by four hinge fittings to the trailing edge of each aileron. 
The tab is connected to the aileron by a geared linkage so that the geared tab moves 70% 
of the total aileron movement. At full aileron deflection of 17 degrees, the aileron geared
tab deflects 11.9 degrees in the opposite direction. This action gives aerodynamic 
assistance and reduces the force required to turn the control hand-wheels.</p>
