<p><strong>Rudder Control System </strong></p>

<p>The FCECU does the functions that follow:<br>

<ul>
	<li>Limits the rudder hinge moment by regulating the pressure in the rudder PCU according to aircraft speed.</li>
	<li>Monitors the airspeed signals for a mismatch condition and sets the rudder PCU regulated pressure to a default mode.</li>
	<li>Monitors the regulated pressure in the rudder PCU for discrepancies and depressurizes the PCU if it is faulty.</li>
	<li>Depressurizes the relevant rudder PCU if either of the RUD 1 or RUD 2 PUSH OFF switchlight is pushed.</li>
	<li>Increases the pressure to the operating rudder PCU if one of the rudder PCUs fails or is depressurized.</li>
	<li>Sends signals to the rudder caution lights and pushoff switchlights to indicate system malfunctions.</li>
	<li>Supplies electrical excitation of the upper and lower rudder position LVDTs</li>
	<li>Receives position data from the upper and lower rudder LVDTs and transmits the data to the FDR and EFIS by way of the IFC</li>
</ul>
