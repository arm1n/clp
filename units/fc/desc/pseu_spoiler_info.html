<p>Ground Mode: With the engine power levers at or below flight
idle plus 12 degrees and the two Weight-On-Wheels signals
(WOW1 and WOW2) supplied from the Proximity Sensor
Electronic Unit (PSEU), the FCECU energizes all the lift dump
valves. All four spoiler panels will fully extend and the lift made
by the wings will decrease. The FLIGHT/TAXI switch must be in
the FLIGHT position.</p>
