<p><strong>Spoiler Control System</strong></p>

<p>The FCECU does the functions that follow:<br>

- Locks out the outboard spoilers for airspeeds greater than 170 kt (315 km/h).<br>
- Operates both the inboard and outboard spoilers to dump the lift from the wings when the aircraft lands.<br>
- Sends a signal to the spoiler caution and warning lights to indicate system malfunctions<br>
- Supplies electrical excitation of the inboard and outboard spoiler position LVDTs<br>
- Receives position data from the inboard and outboard spoiler LVDTs and transmits the data to the FDR and EFIS by way of the IFC.</p>
