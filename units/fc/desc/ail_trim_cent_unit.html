<p><strong>The Aileron Trim and Centering Unit (ATCU)</strong></p>

<p>The Aileron Trim and Centering Unit (ATCU) has a torsion spring bar
which is connected to the aileron trim actuator and to the aileron
forward quadrant. The AILERON trim switch, located on the TRIM
panel, controls the trim actuator and allows the pilot to trim the
ailerons to a desired position. Input commands are transmitted from
the aileron trim switch, through the trim and centering unit to the
aileron forward quadrant to move both aileron control surfaces. </p>

<p> The
aileron trim position is shown on the aileron trim indicator located on
the TRIM panel in the centre console. The torsion spring bar keeps
the handwheels centered about this trimmed position to reduce pilot
workload.</p>
