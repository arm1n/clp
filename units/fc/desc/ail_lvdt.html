<p><strong>LVDT, Aileron Position</strong></p>

<p>Refer to Figure 10. A Linear Variable Differential Transformer (LVDT)
monitors the position of the ailerons by supplying an electrical signal
equivalent to the angular position of the flight control surface.</p>

<p>A single LVDT is located in the right wing adjacent to the aileron. It
monitors the position of the right aileron surface then transmits the
aileron position data to the Flight Data Recorder (FDR).</p>
