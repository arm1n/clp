<p><strong>Stick Pusher Capstan/Actuator</strong></p>

<p>The stick pusher quadrant receives input from the stick pusher capstan to operate the elevator 
control cables so that the control column is pushed forward when a stall condition is sensed. It has springs that supply tension regulation of the control cable system.</p>

<p>The stick pusher actuator is attached to the stick pusher capstan. The stick pusher actuator may be removed from the aircraft without removing the stick pusher capstan. Two aircraft cables are attached to the capstan pulley using staged ball fittings that anchor to pockets in the pulley.</p>



<p>The stick pusher actuator gives the actual stick push when commanded by the Stall Protection Modules (SPM1, SPM2). The stick pusher capstan gives the mechanical interface with the aircraft elevator control system. The stick pusher capstan has an override slip clutch that lets the cable pulley turn if the stick pusher actuator cannot be moved because of a mechanical malfunction.</p>
