<p><strong>Elevator System</strong></p>

<p>The elevator system transmits the pitch commands from the pilot’s and copilot’s control columns to the elevator control surfaces. The elevator surfaces move in proportion to the amount of control column movement.</p>

<p>The left and right elevators are installed on the trailing edge of the left and right horizontal stabilizers, respectively. The elevators are moved down to pitch the aircraft nose down and moved up to pitch the aircraft nose up, around the lateral axis.</p>

<p>The elevators are positioned by commands from either the pilot control system or the Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS). Trim control and surface position indication is also supplied for each elevator.</p>

<p>Trimming of the elevator control system gives the aircraft longitudinal stability during flight. Trimming counters the effects of changes to the aircraft centre of gravity, airspeed and lift during flap extension or retraction.</p>
