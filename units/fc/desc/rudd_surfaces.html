<p><strong>RUDDER SURFACES</strong></p>

<p>The rudder is a primary flight control surface that is attached to the
rear spar of the vertical stabilizer.</p>

<p>The rudder is divided into two sections:
- Rudder, Fore 
- Rudder, Trailing </p>

<p>There are two rudder surfaces, the fore rudder and the aft or trailing rudder. Both surfaces extend almost the entire length of the trailing edge of the vertical stabilizer. The rudders are attached to the aircraft through a series of hinges and safety hinges. Each rudder rotates on sealed bearings. The fore rudder is attached to the rear spar of the vertical stabilizer and is actuated by two Power Control Units (PCUs). The aft rudder is attached to the fore rudder by hinges and is actuated by pushrods so that the aft rudder deflects twice as far as the fore rudder.</p>
