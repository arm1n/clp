<p><strong>Rudder Aft Quadrant</strong></p>

<p>The rudder aft quadrant is located halfway up the vertical stabilizer 
next to the Power Control Unit. 
It is the last quadrant in the rudder control system. The rudder aft
quadrant transmits rudder control inputs from the mixer quadrant to
the Power Control Units. The rudder aft quadrant has the primary
travel stops for the rudder cable system.
Rotation of the aft quadrant is opposed by two feel springs, which
supply an artificial feel to the rudder pedals.</p>
