<p><strong>Trim-Ground Adjustable Tab</strong></p>

<p>A ground adjustable trim tab is located on the trailing edge of the right aileron, 
inboard of the geared tab. The tab is used to adjust for any aerodynamic 
asymmetry between the left and right ailerons due to manufacturing tolerances. 
The trim tab is adjusted by maintenance personnel after a test flight and only as
required thereafter.</p>
