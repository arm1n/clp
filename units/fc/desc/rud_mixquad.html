<p><strong>Rudder Mixer Quadrant</strong></p>

<p>The mixer quadrant is a three-pulley quadrant installed below the cabin floor, aft of the turbine rotor burst zone. It combines rudder control from the two rudder forward quadrants and transmits it to the rudder aft quadrant. The two pairs of control cables are routed aft from the rudder forward quadrants to
the upper two pulleys of the mixer quadrant. From the lower pulley of
the mixer quadrant, a single pair of cables is routed aft and below the
left side of the cabin floor. The cables pass through the pressurization seal at the rear pressure dome in the aft fuselage, then up to the rudder aft quadrant in the vertical stabilizer. </p>

<p><strong>This dual cable arrangement ensures continued rudder control if a single cable failure occurs between either the pilot or copilot's rudder pedals and the mixer quadrant.</strong></p>
