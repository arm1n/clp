<p><strong>ELEVATOR PCU INPUT BUNGEE</strong></p>

<p>The elevator control system has eight overload bungees. Two bungees are located in the 
elevator control circuit; one between the right aft quadrant and its related torque tube and 
the other between the left aft quadrant and its related torque tube. </p>

<p>The other six overload bungees are installed in series between the two PCU input torque 
tubes and the six elevator PCUs. The overload bungees contract or expand to compensate 
for structural deflection or thermal expansion or contraction. This prevents structural 
damage to the elevator surfaces or the surrounding structure. The overload bungees also 
prevent any damage to the elevator control circuit in the event of a jam in one or more of 
the elevator PCUs.</p>
