<p><strong>Aileron Terminal Quadrant</strong></p>

<p>There are two aileron terminal quadrants, one in each wing. Each aileron terminal 
quadrant is located on the wing rear spar adjacent to its related aileron.</p>

<p>The aileron terminal quadrant is the last quadrant in the control linkage from the 
copilot's control column to the aileron. The terminal quadrant transmits aileron 
cable control from the aileron splitter quadrant to the aileron itself. </p>

<p>The quadrant is connected to the aileron by a lever and a control rod.</p>
