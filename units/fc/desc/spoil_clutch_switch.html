<p><strong>Clutch Units</strong></p>

<p>The clutch units, one in each wing are installed centrally below the two spoiler panels. The clutch units operate the spoiler actuator input levers through two pushrods and one bellcrank. </p>

<p>The units contain clutch mechanisms to allow for a jam in the controls for either spoiler panel, while keeping control over the remaining spoiler system. If the linkage jams, a force of approximately 27 lb ( 12.25 kg) will cause disengagement of the clutch and the clutch will slip. When the clutch slips it operates a microswitch, causing the inboard or outboard spoiler switchlight (SPLR1 or SPLR 2 PUSH OFF) to come on. Pressing the switchlight will depressurize the applicable spoiler system.</p>
