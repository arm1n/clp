<p><strong>Rudder Forward R/H Quadrant</strong></p>

<p>There are two rudder forward quadrants, one located below the pilot's 
rudder pedals and the other located below the copilot's rudder pedals. 
Each rudder forward quadrant is connected to its applicable pair of rudder 
pedals through a series of tubes and levers. The rudder forward quadrant 
transmits rudder cable control movement from the rudder pedals aft to the
mixer quadrant.</p>

<p>A rudder input restrictor mechanism, limits rudder pedal movement with flap 
selector operation. The flap selector lever is mechanically linked to the 
copilot's rudder forward quadrant. The restrictor limits rudder travel to 
12 degrees left and right of centre when 0 degrees flap is selected. 
When 5 degree flap or greater is selected, full rudder travel of 18 degrees 
left and 20 degrees right of centre is available.</p>
