<p><strong>Aileron Trim Panel</strong></p>

<p>The pilot controls the amount of aileron trim by operating the aileron
trim switch, which supplies the electrical signal to the aileron trim
actuator. Selection of the LWD position moves the left aileron up and
the right aileron down. Selection of the RWD position moves the left
aileron down and the right aileron up.</p>

<p>The AILERON trim switch has three positions:<br>- LWD (left wing down)
<br>- RWD (right wing down)<br>
- Center-off</p>

<p>The switch is spring-loaded to return to the center-off position.</p>
