		<clp-td>The CAWP FLAP POWER caution light is latched on and no more flap movement is possible when the flap control unit (FCU) senses a condition that follows:

			<ul>
				<li>Flap asymmetry</li>
				<li>Uncommanded movement </li>
				<li>A position transducer has malfunctioned</li>
				<li>The flap lever transducer has malfunctioned</li>
				<li>The arming switch has malfunctioned</li>
				<li>The FCU has malfunctioned</li>
			</ul>

			<div>There are two possible conditions that can cause the FLAP POWER caution light to come on as nuisance fault:</div>

			<ul>
				<li>The FLAP POWER caution light will come on if you move the flap control lever to a different position and there is no pressure in the No. 1 hydraulic system for six seconds.</li>
				<li>The FLAP POWER caution light will come on if you move the flap control lever to a different position and the release trigger does not go to the bottom of the detent for 10 seconds.</li>
			</ul>

		<clp-td>The CAWP FLAP DRIVE caution light comes on when the flap control unit (FCU) senses a condition that follows:
			<ul>
				<li>Hydraulic pressure is sensed with no flap selection (the shutâˆ’off valve stays open after the flap movement is completed)</li>
				<li>The flap panels have stopped moving (stalled) before reaching the set position (a difference between flap position selection and flap position indication is sensed)</li>
				<li>The FCU has malfunctioned.</li>
			</ul>
			<clp-text-blue><strong>NOTE:</strong> The flap system will continue to operate in a degraded mode when the FLAP.</clp-text-blue>
