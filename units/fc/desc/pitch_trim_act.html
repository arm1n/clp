<p><strong>PITCH TRIM ACTUATOR</strong></p>


<p>Two pitch trim actuators installed on top of the pitch feel and trim units supply elevator trim. The elevator trim actuator is controlled automatically by the autopilot or manually by the trim switches on the pilot's and copilot's control handwheels. <br><br>
Elevator trim position is shown in the flight compartment on the elevator trim indicator located on the left side of the centre console.<br><br>
An aural warning sounds if a take-off is attempted with the elevator trim position outside the take-off range.</p>
