<p><strong>Roll Spoilers System</strong></p>

<p>The roll spoilers are a secondary flight control system. They are hydraulically powered and operate with, and in proportion to, the aileron control system to give lateral control of the aircraft in flight. The roll spoilers also decrease the lift made by the wings on landing.</p>

<p>There are two hydraulically powered roll spoilers on each wing. The roll spoilers operate with the ailerons to give lateral control of the aircraft in flight. Rotary movement of either the pilot’s or the copilot’s control handwheels operates the ailerons and the spoilers at the same time through an interconnect rod joining the two control columns. The ailerons and the roll spoilers can be disconnected from each other if a jam occurs in either system. The aircraft can then be operated with limited roll control by using the unjammed system.</p>

<p><b>Ground Spoiler System</b></p>

<p>Four spoiler panels are installed on the upper surface of the wing forward of the outboard flaps. The panels are identified as inboard and outboard and are operated hydromechanically using control wheel inputs in conjunction with the ailerons. The inboard and outboard spoilers are hinged to the upper surface of the wing. The Power Control Units (PCUs) attached to the inboard panels, are supplied with hydraulic pressure from No.1 hydraulic system. The PCUs attached to the outboard panels are supplied by No.2 hydraulic system.</p>
