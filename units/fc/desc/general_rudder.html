<p><strong>Rudder System</strong></p>

<p>The rudder system transmits the yaw commands from the pilot’s and copilot’s rudder pedals to the rudder through a series of quadrants, cables, levers and pushrods. Movement of the rudder pedals is transmitted to two hydraulic Power Control Units (PCUs). The PCUs move the rudder in proportion to the amount of rudder pedal input. The rudder system also has inputs from the Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS) and the rudder trim actuator.</p>
