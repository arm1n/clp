<p><strong>Spoiler Lift Dump Valves</strong></p>

<p>The two lift dump valves for the inboard (No. 1) spoiler system are located on the left side of the aircraft in the wing-to-fuselage attachment area. The two lift dump valves for the 
outboard (No. 2) spoiler system are located on the right side of the aircraft also in the wing-to-fuselage attachment area.</p>

<p>The two valves in each system are connected hydraulically in series. Both valves must open to let extend pressure through to the related spoiler PCU. This reduces the possibility of in flight symmetric deployment. 
After landing, with the aircraft weight-on-wheels signal and both power levers set below flight idle +12 degrees, all lift dump solenoid valves are energized. This supplies hydraulic pressure to the extend side of both spoiler actuators, extending all spoiler panels symmetrically.

<p>The ROLL SPLR INBD GND or ROLL SPLR OUTBD GND caution lights come on:<br>
- If the Flight Control Electronic Control Unit (FCECU) senses a loss of lift dump valve function<br>
- If the lift dump valves are operated but the spoiler panels fail to extend after landing<br>
- If the spoiler panels extend when the FCECU carries out the lift dump Built In Test (BIT), with the   FLIGHT/TAXI switch set to TAXI.</p>
