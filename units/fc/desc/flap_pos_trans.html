<p><strong>Flap Position Transducer</strong></p>

<p>There are two flap position transducers. They are installed on the outboard flap actuator of each wing. Each flap position transducer is a two section Rotary Variable Differential Transformer (RVDT) consisting of channel A and channel B. Channel A is electrically supplied by the Flap Control Unit (FCU) and supplies flap position feedback to the flap control loop. Channel B is electrically supplied by the FPIU and supplies flap position data for
indication purposes.</p>
