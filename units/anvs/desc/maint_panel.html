<p><strong>Maintenance Panel</strong></p>

<p>The maintenance panel is a part of the Central Diagnostics System (CDS). It is used to access and clear (reset) fault and degraded conditions. The panel is used only when the ANVS is in the Maintenance Mode and with the aircraft on the ground.</p>

<p>The ANVS SYS DEGRADED LED is installed on the maintenance panel. The maintenance panel is installed in the avionics rack on the left side of the aircraft.</p>

<p>One failed ATVA or microphone channel does not cause the ANVS SYS DEGRADED LED or the NVS INOP LED to come on.</p>

<p>Two failed channels cause the ANVS SYS DEGRADED lamp to come on, and four failed channels cause the NVS INOP LED to come on.</p>
