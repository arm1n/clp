<p><strong>Power Amplifier</strong></p>

<p>The unit is a high efficiency class D switching amplifier. It is connected to the controller output drive signal with a “quick−disconnect” connector twisted pair cable.</p>

<p>The aircraft 28 V dc bus supplies electrical power to the PA. It also supplies up to 20 watts (rms) of power to its associated ATVA.</p>

<p>Feedback signals from the actuators to the controller control the vibration intensity levels.</p>
