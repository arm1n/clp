<p><strong>Sensors âˆ’ Microphones</strong></p>

<p>Miniature electric microphones connected to interface circuitry are encapsulated in sealed molded enclosures. Each enclosure is attached to a trim panel through a mounting plate and gasket on the side wall, ceiling panel and overhead storage bins.</p>

<p>There are 25 microphones installed on the side wall, 13 microphones installed on ceiling panel and 42 microphones installed on overhead storage bins.</p>

<p>The controller supplies a bias voltage of 22 to 28 V dc to each microphone through a twisted pair cable. The microphone output signals are sent back to the controller superimposed on the bias voltage.</p>
