<p><strong>Sensors âˆ’ Accelerometers</strong></p>

<p>The accelerometers used in the ANVS are small piezo electric sensors. The sensors are connected to interface circuitry and contained in sealed metal enclosures. Each enclosure is held in position with a bracket installed on the seat rail at stations LHS X 176 and X 236 and RHS X 204 and X 301.</p>

<p>The controller supplies a bias voltage of 22 to 28 V dc to each accelerometer through a twisted pair cable. The accelerometer output signals are sent back to the controller superimposed on the bias voltage.</p>
