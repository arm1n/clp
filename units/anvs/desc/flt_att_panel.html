<p>When the PAUSE push−button switch on the flight attendant panel is pushed, its indicator comes on and the system is held in the standby mode. In this condition, if the aircraft power is switched off and on again, the system continues to be in the standby mode until the PAUSE switch is pushed again. At that time, its indicator goes off and the system starts again.</p>
