<p><strong>Input/Output Processor (IOP 1, IOP 2)</strong></p>


<p>The Input/Output Processors (IOP 1, IOP 2) receives, calculates, and then transmits data to other avionics systems. Each FDPS has an IOP and IOM. The FDPS and the Centralized Diagnostic System (CDS) uses the same processor located on the
Input/Output Processor (IOP1) module but they function independently.</p>

<p>The IOPs are Line Replaceable Modules (LRM) that are located in their related IFC</p>
