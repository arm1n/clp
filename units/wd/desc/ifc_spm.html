<p><strong>The Stall Protection Modules (SPM1, SPM2)</strong></p>

<div>The Stall Protection Module (SPM1, SPM2) has the two electronic circuit boards that follow:</div>
<ul>
	<li>Extension board</li>
	<li>Central Processing Unit (CPU) board</li>
</ul>



<p>One part of the extension board is for the Stall Protection System (SPS) and the other part is used by Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) for input/output processing.The SPM uses discrete signals and ARINC 429 interfaces between the Central Processing Unit (CPU) and external boards. The SPM make a reference voltage for AOA transducer resolvers that is 7 Vac, 2500 Hz.</p>


<div>The Stall Protection Modules (SPM1, SPM2) transmit data to the components that follow:</div>
<ul>
	<li>Flight Guidance Module (FGM1,FGM2)</li>
	<li>Stick shakers</li>
	<li>Stick pusher</li>
	<li>Caution and Warning Annunicator Lights Panel</li>
	<li>Flight Data Concentrator (FDC)</li>
	<li>Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS)</li>
	<li> Central Diagnostics System (CDS)</li>
</ul>



<p>The SPMs are Line Replaceable Modules (LRM) that are located in their related IFC.</p>
