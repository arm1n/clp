<p><strong>Input/Output Processor (IOP 1, IOP 2)</strong></p>


<p>The Input/Output Processors (IOP 1, IOP 2) receives, calculates, and then transmits data to other avionics systems. Each FDPS has an IOP and IOM. The FDPS and the Centralized Diagnostic System (CDS) uses the same processor located on the
Input/Output Processor (IOP1) module but they function independently.</p>

<p>The IOPs are Line Replaceable Modules (LRM) that are located in their related IFC</p>

<p>IDPs indicate a signal condition that ice is accumulating on the aircraft. The signal condition provides an ICE DETECTED message on the ED.either sensor through Input/Output Processor (IOP1 or IOP2).</p>

<p>The ICE DETECTED message is out of view when no ice is detected.</p>
