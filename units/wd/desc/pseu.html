<p><strong>Proximity Sensor Electronicâˆ’Unit</strong></p>

<p>The Proximity Sensor Electronic Unit provides visual indication in the Flight Deck for gear position, gear doors position, and fuselage doors status. The system provides discrete outputs to other aircraft systems.</p>

<p>Each SPM compares the WOW1 and WOW2 discrete signals from the Proximity Sensor
Electronics Unit (PSEU). If the WOW1 and WOW2 discrete signals disagree, the SPM will use true airspeed and radio altitude to sense the in flight or on ground status of the aircraft.</p>


<div>The primary functions of the Proximity Sensor Electronic Unit (PSEU) are as follows:</div> 
<ul>
	<li>Monitor and operate the indicators of the landing gear extension and retraction system</li>
	<li>Supply sequence signals to operate the landing-gear door sequence valves</li>
	<li>Monitor the uplock, downlock, and WOW data to other systems</li>
	<li>Give the landing gear position and WOW data to other systems</li>
	<li>Give an indication when the passenger and/or baggage doors are not closed correctly</li>
	
</ul>
