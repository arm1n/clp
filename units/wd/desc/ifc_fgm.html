<p><strong>FLIGHT GUIDANCE MODULE (FGM)</strong></p>

<div>Each FGM module has two electronic boards as follows:</div>
<ul>
	<li>CPU Board (the main power supply, processing unit, ARINC and discrete inputs and outputs interfacing)</li>
	<li>Extension Board (AFCS discrete and analogue inputs and output interfaces, AP and YD hardware logic)</li>
</ul>



<p>The extension board is only necessary for the AP and YD functions. So, the FD functions can be used without the extension board, except for the TCS function. With this construction, it is possible to have a malfunction of the FD and still have AP/YD operation.</p>


<div>The flight guidance modules have the FD functions that follow:</div>
<ul>
	<li>FD mode selections</li>
	<li>FD command calculations</li>
	<li>Sensor selection and monitoring</li>
	
</ul>
<p>Only one FGM is necessary to do the FD function.</p>


<p>The FGMs are Line Replaceable Modules (LRM) that are located in their related IFC.</p>
