<p><strong>Passenger Address Amplifier</strong></p>

<p>The PAA increases its output power by 6 dB when the engines are operating to compensate for engine noise. The Full Authority Digital Engine Control system (FADEC1, FADEC2) supplies oil pressure sensor data to the PAA through the Input/Output Modules (IOM1, IOM2) located in their related Integrated Flight Cabinets (IFC1, IFC2). The front panel has gain and sensitivity potentiometers to adjust the system. </p>

<p>The PAA supplies a signal to the three ALPs that are located in the cabin ceiling to visually alert the flight attendants of a call. The PAA supplies an output signal to the left and right cabin speaker network for cabin audio operation. The PA output is connected to 44 speakers in a series and parallel electrical network. Two isolated PAA outputs are supplied to the left and right side speaker networks from the PAA. The PAA supplies a discrete signal to the CDS to show its condition. The discrete signal is at ground potential when the PAA is operational and if the discrete goes open, the PAA is considered failed.</p>

<div>The audio power amplifier supplies audio directly to the cabin speakers from the sources that follow:</div>

<ul>
