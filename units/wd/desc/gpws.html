<p>The Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) gives aural and visual indications of possible Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT). The Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) can be tested and diagnosed only when the aircraft is on the ground.</p>

<div>The Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) gives visual and aural indications for the conditions that follow:</div>
<ul>
	<li>Excessive descent rate</li>
	<li>Excessive closure rate to terrain</li>
	<li>Descent after takeoff</li>
	<li>Insufficient terrain clearance</li>
	<li>Excessive descent below the glideslope</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) gives excessive bank angle and Decision Height (DH) callouts.</p>
<p>Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) lets the pilots override unwanted indications when landing with zero or partial flaps and cancel glideslope indications.</p>


<div>The Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) indications are automatically cancelled by the conditions that follow:</div>
<ul>
	<li>Stall</li>
	<li>Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) malfunction sensed</li>
</ul>


<div>The Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) has the components that follow:</div>
<ul>
	<li>Computer, GPWS</li>
	<li>Switch, Annunciator−Flap Override</li>
	<li>Switch, Annunciator−GPWS and GS Alert </li>
