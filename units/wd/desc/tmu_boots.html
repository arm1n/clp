<p><strong>Timer and Monitor Unit (TMU) </strong></p>

<p>The Timer and Monitor Unit (TMU) sequences the Dual Distributing Valve (DDV), also referred to as Heated Dual 
Distributing Valve (HDDV) operation according to a pre−defined cycle. It commands the DDV to distribute air supply through one of its outputs.</p>

<p>After the inflation cycle time, it commands the DDV to let air flow back and exhaust through the ejector. During this 
cycle, the timer monitors the operation of the low pressure switches incorporated in each DDV output to confirm 
the operation of the DDV. The timer controls the de−icing cycles according to the selected operating mode, <b>SLOW or FAST</b>, and also controls the heaters of all heated equipment of the de−icing system.

<p>The Static Air Temperature (SAT) information through an ARINC link with the avionics is used to activate the heaters.</p>
