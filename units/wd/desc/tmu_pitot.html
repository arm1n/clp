<p><strong>Timer and Monitor Unit (TMU) </strong></p>

<p>The Timer Monitor Unit (TMU) monitors the current of the pitot−static probe heaters. The Timer Monitor Unit (TMU) senses a defective pitot/static heater and sends the fault code to the Air Data Units (ADUs). Selection of pneumatic de−icing using the AIRFRAME MODE SELECT Switch or AIRFRAME MANUAL Switch is sent to each Stall Protection Module (SPM).</p>

<p>When the probe heater is selected on and the heater electrical current is out of specified limits, or if the heating is not activated, the Timer Monitor Unit (TMU) senses a defective heater and the respective PITOT HEAT 1, PITOT HEAT 2, or STBY PITOT caution light on the Caution and Warning Panel comes on. Fault codes are stored in the Timer Monitor Unit (TMU) for maintenance purposes. The maintenance messages associated with the fault codes are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>PITOT 1 FAIL</li>
	<li>PITOT 2 FAIL</li>
	<li>PITOT STBY FAIL</li>

</ul>
