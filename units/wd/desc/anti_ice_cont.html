<p><strong>Controllers, Anti−icing</strong></p>

<p>Two Anti−Ice Controllers (AICs) control heater operation to prevent ice 
accumulating on the windshields and the pilot’s side window. The AICs activate 
the heaters using relays. The relays are used to isolate the AICs from the high 
current flow required for heating.</p>


<p>When the windshield control is in the OFF 
position, the deactivation relay is controlled using the overheat temperature 
sensor. The activation relay stays open regardless of the normal temperature 
sensorinformation. In the WARM−UP or NORM modes, the Anti−Ice Controller (AIC) uses the normal temperature sensor information to control the activation 
relay and the overheat temperature sensor to control the deactivation relay.</p>
