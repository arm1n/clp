<p>The discrete, force, position and pressure sensors measure the control column inputs and also the affector response. The aircraft system sensors convert the control column inputs into electrical signals and transmit them to Flight Data Recorder Signal Conditioning Unit (FSCU). The FSCU supplies excitation, demodulation and filtering signal for the sensing devices. The FSCU also supplies ARINC 429 data for the Flight Data Recorder (FDR). The FSCU operates with two Computer Software Configuration Items (CSCI).</p>

<div>The FSCU supplies analog inputs to interface with the devices that follow:</div>
<ul>
	<li>Potentiometers</li>
	<li>Linear Variable Differential Transformers (LVDTs)</li>
	<li>Pressure Sensors</li>
</ul>
