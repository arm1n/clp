<p><strong>Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) system</strong></p>

<div>The Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) system transmits Radio Frequency (RF) pulse-pairs to a ground station. It measures the time it takes for the signal to travel to the station and back to make the calculations that follow:</div> 
<ul>
	<li>Distance to station</li>
	<li>Ground Speed</li>
	<li>Time-to-go</li>
</ul>

<p>The VHF Navigation Receivers (VHF NAV1, VHF NAV2) tune the Distance Measuring Equipment (DME1, DME2) from an Audio and Radio Control Display Units (ARCDU1, ARCDU2) selection. A DME HOLD selection is used to keep the current DME station active when a new frequency is selected. The Microwave Landing System Receivers (MLS1 , MLS2) tune the Distance Measuring Equipment (DME1, DME2) to its paired channel selection when the Microwave Landing System is used. 
The Audio and Radio Control Display Units (ARCDU1, ARCDU2) are used to make the DME audio selections. The observer uses a Audio Control Panel (ACP) to set the DME audio. </p>

<div>The Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS1, EFIS2) shows the Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) parameters that follow: </div>
<ul>
	<li>Slant Range</li>
	<li>Time To Station</li>
	<li>Ground Speed</li>
	<li>DME Hold</li>
</ul>

<p>The Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) system supplies data from multiple ground stations to the Flight Management System (FMS) to calculate its position-fixing algorithm. </p>
