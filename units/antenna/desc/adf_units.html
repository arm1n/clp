<p><strong>Automatic Direction Finding (ADF 1, ADF 2)</strong></p>

<p>Two Automatic Direction Finding (ADF 1, ADF 2) systems function independently to continuously show the magnetic bearing to the 
selected ground stations. 
The Automatic Direction Finding (ADF 1, ADF 2) system removes the audio identification from the transmitting signal and sends it to 
the Audio and Radio Management System (ARMS). 
</p>

<p>The ADF sytem is controlled by the components that follow:
<ul>
	<li>Audio and Radio Control Display Units (ARCDU1, ARCDU 2)</li>
	<li>Flight Management System (FMS 1, FMS 2)</li>
</ul>

    
<p>The Audio and Radio Control Display Units (ARCDU1, ARCDU 2) are used to manually tune the ADF system frequencies and to control the audio level. The Flight Management System (FMS) is used to tune the ADF frequencies when the Audio and Radio Control Display Unit (ARCDU1, ARCDU 2) malfunctions. The observer uses an audio control panel to control audio level only. The Audio and Radio Control Display Unit (ARCDU 1, ARCDU 2) or the Flight Management System (FMS 1, FMS 2) are used to manually start the Automatic Direction Finding (ADF) system self-tests. The Electronic Instrument System (EIS) shows the Automatic Direction Finding (ADF) system bearing information. 
</p>

<p>The Automatic Direction Finding (ADF) system has the components that follow:
<ul>
	<li>Receiver, ADF</li>
	<li>Antenna, ADF</li>
</ul>
  
<p>The ADF Receivers (ADF 1, ADF 2) supply data to the systems that follow: 
<ul>
	<li>Audio and Radio Management System (ARMS)</li>
	<li>Input/Output Processors (IOP 1, IOP 2)</li>
	<li>Flight Management System (FMS)</li>
</ul>
