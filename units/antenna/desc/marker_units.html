<p><strong>Marker Beacons</strong></p>

<p>The Marker Beacons are navigation aids that transmit a low power signal to mark an area above themselves. They are located along the centreline of the runway. </p>
<ul>
	<li>Outer, 4 to 7 mi (6.4 to 11.3 km)</li>
	<li>Middle, 3250 to 3750 ft (991 to 1143 m)</li>
	<li>Inner, 300 to 2650 ft (91.4 to 807.7 m)</li>
</ul>

<p>
A large number of Instrument Landing Systems (ILS) have middle and outermarker beacons. The inner marker is rarely used.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Outer marker, two dashes modulated by 400 Hz</li>
	<li>Middle marker, alternating dot and dashes modulated by 1300Hz</li>
	<li>Inner marker, six dots per second modulated by 3000 Hz</li>
</ul>

<p>As the aircraft approaches the runway, each successive marker has ahigher tone. The length of time that the aircraft receives the marker beaconinformation varies with the speed and altitude of the aircraft. The receptiontime of the middle marker is about half that of the outer marker. The receptiontime of the inner marker is about half that ofthe middle marker.</p>
