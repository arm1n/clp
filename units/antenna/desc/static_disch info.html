			<p><strong>Static Dischargers</strong></p>
			<p>The static discharging system consists of dischargers which dissipate electrostatic charges from the aircraft structure to the surrounding air, to minimize radio interference caused by these charges.</p>

			<p>As the aircraft moves through the air, the aerodynamic end cap at the trailing end of each discharger creates an area of low pressure around the slightly protruding carbon tip. This reduction in pressure increases discharge efficiency, and allows ionization to take place in the slipstream, due to the impressed potential between the electrified aircraft and the surrounding air dielectric.</p>
