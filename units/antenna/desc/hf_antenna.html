<p><strong>High Frequency (HF) communication</strong></p>

<p>The High Frequency (HF) communication system provides long−range, two way Single Sideband (SSB), Amplitude Modulation (AM), voice and data communication.</p>

<p>The HF communication system transmits and receives high frequency communication signals in the 2.0 to 29.9999 MHz frequency range of the radio spectrum with 100 Hz channel spacing. The HF is controlled by a control unit and the Audio and Radio Control Display Units (ARCDUs). The control unit setup the functions of the HF and the ARCDUs utilizes the HF audio and transmitter setup.
</p>

<p>The HF communication system transmits and receives signals through a single omnidirectional HF shunt antenna, that is part of the leading edge vertical stabilizer. The shunt antenna function by developing a very high RF current up to 50 Amps at very low RF voltages.
