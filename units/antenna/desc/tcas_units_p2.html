<p><strong>TCAS</strong></p>

<p>The TA indication uses different symbols and colours to show the relative threat of the intruder aircraft. A related synthesized voice announcement also sounds. Resolution Advisory (RA): If the intruder continues to close, the Inertial Vertical Speed Indicator (IVSI) shows a Resolution Advisory (RA) to maintain a safe vertical separation between the aircraft and the intruder. The RA indication has red and green arcs on the IVSI scale to show the required rate of climb or descent to prevent a possible collision.</p> 

	<div>
	<clp-text-blue><strong>NOTE:</strong> The TCAS II calculates the RA indication on a five second crew reaction time to get sufficient separation. A two and one half seconds reaction time is given when there is a change in the RA indication.</clp-text-blue>
