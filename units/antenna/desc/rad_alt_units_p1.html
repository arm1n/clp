<p><strong>Radio Altimeter (RA)</strong></p>

<div>The Radio Altimeter (RA) system transmits a signal to the ground and then it receives the reflected signal to calculate the Above Ground Level (AGL) altitude. The aircraft Primary Flight Displays (PFD1, PFD2) show the Radio Altimeter (RA) system parameters that follow:</div>
<ul>
	<li>Above Ground Level (AGL) altitude</li>
	<li>RA mismatch</li>
	<li>Rising runway symbol</li>
	<li>DH status</li>
</ul>

<p>The RA Sysem is used to make Decision Height (DH) calculations. The AGL altitude data is compared to the DH value set by the flight crew. The Primary Flight Displays (PFD1, PFD2) shows the selected value. The Electronic Instrument System (EFIS) and Audio and Radio Management System (ARMS) is used to alert the flight crew both visually and aurally when the aircraft reaches the set value. In addition, the Radio Altimeter system supplies a signal to the Stall Protection System to prevent it from operating when the altitude is less than 500 ft (152 m) AGL. </p>

<div>The Radio Altimeter (RA) system has the components that follow:</div> 
<ul>
	<li>Transmitter/receiver</li>
	<li>Transmitter/receiver Antenna</li>
</ul>
