<p><strong>Air Traffic Control (ATC) </strong></p>

<p>A Coaxial Cable Switch connects each transponder to an upper and lower fitted L-band omni-directional antennae. The Mode S Transponder system interfaces with both of the Audio and Radio Control Display Units (ARCDU1, ARCDU2) and the Flight Management System (FMS). Pilot inputs to the ARCDU and the FMS control the operating modes of the transponder. <br>In addition to mode selections, the ARCDU1and the FMS sends a pilot selected four-digit octal code to the transponders. The Mode S Transponder system interfaces with the Air Data System (ADS). 
It converts altitude information from the ADS into formats required for Mode C and Mode S replies.
