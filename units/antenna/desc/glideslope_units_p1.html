<p><strong>Glideslope Antenna</strong></p>

<p>The two VHF Navigation System operates in VOR or ILS mode depending on frequency selection. 
In the VOR mode, the navigation receiver measures the deviation from the selected radial of the Very High Frequency Omni-range (VOR) ground transmitting station. 
</p>

<div>In the Instrument Landing System (ILS) mode, the Navigation Receiver uses the following landing aids:</div>
<ul>
	<li>Localizer (LOC)</li>
	<li>Glideslope (GS)</li>
	<li>Marker beacon (MB)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Localizer (LOC) system helps to guide the aircraft to the centreline approach path to the runway. The Glideslope (GS) system gives the approach angle of an aircraft. It helps to guide the aircraft down an approximate 3 degree glidepath. The Marker Beacons (MB) designate and mark an area above themselves. Up to three MBs are located near the centreline of the approach to the runway. </p>
<div>They use the following designations:</div>
<ul>
	<li>Outer</li>
	<li>Middle</li>
	<li>Inner</li>
</ul>

<p>The Very High Frequency Omni-Range (VOR) and Localizer (LOC) ground stations periodically transmit an identification signal. The navigation receiver supplies the audio to the Audio and Radio Management System (ARMS). The Marker Beacon (MB) continuously transmits its identification signal. The navigation receiver, receives the Marker Beacon (MB) audio when directly above the transmitter. The audio is supplied to the Audio and Radio Management System (ARMS). </p>
