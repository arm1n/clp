<p><strong>TCAS</strong></p>

<div>The TCAS II interrogates other aircraft's transponders and uses their replies to calculate the parameters of the intruding aircraft that follow:</div>
<ul>
	<li>Range</li>
	<li>Relative bearing</li>
	<li>Altitude and vertical speed</li>
	<li>Closure rate</li>
</ul>

<p>The TCAS II compares this data with its own position to calculate a potential collision condition, and give an audio and visual indication for vertical avoidance maneuvers. 
NOTE:  Note: TCAS II is unable to detect any intruding aircraft without an operating Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System (ATCRBS) transponder (operating in Mode A and C) or a Mode S transponder.</p>

<div>The Electronic Instrument System (EIS) shows the TCAS II parameters that follow:</div>
<ul>
	<li>Non-Threat Traffic</li>
	<li>Proximity Intruder Traffic</li>
	<li>Traffic Advisory (TA)</li>
	<li>Resolution Advisory (RA)</li>
</ul>

<div>Traffic Advisory (TA): The TA indication shows the intruding aircraft's parameters that follow: </div>
<ul>
	<li>Relative position</li>
	<li>Altitude</li>
	<li>A trend arrow to show if it is climbing or descending at speed more than 500 ft/min (52.4 m/min)</li>
</ul>
