<p><strong>VHF Antenna/Transceiver</strong></p>


<p>There are two VHF communication systems installed. A third unit is optional. Each system operates in the 118 to 137 Megahertz (MHz) frequency spectrum with 8.33 Kilohertz (kHz) channel spacing. It gives short range airborne to ground, ground to airborne, and airborne to airborne communications. The VHF transceiver Amplitude Modulates (AM) the transmission. 
</p>

<div>The VHF transceiver operates in the modes that follow:</div> 
<ul>
	<li>Power-On Self Test (POST)</li>
	<li>Operational</li>
	<li>Maintenance</li>
</ul>

<div>The narrow-band voice mode gives more channels to decrease the VHF radio frequency congestion in Europe. Each VHF transceiver is controlled by the equipment that follows:</div> 
<ul>
	<li>Standby controller for VHF1 transceiver</li>
	<li>Audio and Radio Control Display Units (ARCDU)</li>
	<li>Flight Management System (FMS) Multi-Functional Control Display Units (MCDUs)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<div>
	<clp-text-blue><strong>NOTE:</strong> The MCDUs cannot control VHF3</clp-text-blue>
</div>
<br><br>

<div>The VHF Communication System has the components that follow:</div>
<ul>
	<li>Transceiver</li>
	<li>Unit, standby control</li>
	<li>Antenna</li>
</ul>
