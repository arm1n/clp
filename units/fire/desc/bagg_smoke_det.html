<p><strong>Cargo Compartment Smoke Detectors</strong></p>

<clp-tabs>
	<clp-tab title="PRE MODSUM 4−459223">

		<p>The AFT Baggage Smoke Detectors sense the presence of smoke in the aft baggage (cargo) compartment.</p>

		<p>The AFT baggage compartment has two smoke detectors. Smoke detector 2 is located at the rear and smoke detector 1 is located at the front of the aft baggage compartment. Each smoke detector is a self−contained open−area detector and is a line replaceable unit (LRU). Electrical connections are provided using an external 66 pin connector, keyed to eliminate mismatching.</p>

		<p>During a fire or smoke condition, one or both smoke detectors produce an alarm, based on a predetermined trip set point. This causes the <b>“SMOKE”</b> indicator light on the Fire Protection Panel (FPP) to come on. The control amplifier will automatically operate relay contacts to remove electrical power from the AFT baggage vent inlet and vent outlet shutoff valves, to minimize the air flow within the baggage compartment. Indication of vent valve status will be shown as <b>VENT VALVE INLT</b> and <b>VENT VALVE OTLT</b> lights on the FPP.</p>

		<p>The smoke detectors have a Built−In Test capability that completely tests their functionality in response to a test signal from the FPP.</p>

		<p>On aircraft with ModSum 4−459223 incorporated, the cargo compartment has four smoke detectors. Smoke detector 4 is located at the rear and smoke detector 1 is located at the front of the cargo compartment. Smoke detector 2 and smoke detector 3 are located between the smoke detector 1 and smoke detector 4. Each smoke detector is a self−contained open−area detector and is a line replaceable unit (LRU). Electrical connections are provided using an external 66 pin connector, keyed to eliminate mismatching.</p>

<p>During a fire or smoke condition, one or the other three smoke detectors produce an alarm, based on a predetermined trip set point. This causes the CARGO SMOKE indicator light on the Fire Protection Panel (FPP) to come on. The control amplifier will automatically operate relay contacts to remove electrical power from the cargo compartment vent inlet and vent outlet shutoff valves, to minimize the air flow within the cargo compartment. Indication of vent valve status will be shown as VENT VALVE INLT CLOSED 1 light, VENT VALVE INLT CLOSED 2 light, VENT VALVE OTLT CLOSED 1 light and VENT VALVE OTLT CLOSED 2 light on the FPP.</p>

<p>The smoke detectors have a Built−In Test capability that completely tests their functionality in response to a test signal from the FPP.</p>
