<p><strong>Lavatory Fire Extinguisher</strong></p>


<p>The lavatory fire extinguisher is located in the upper amenity assembly, just above the waste bin. It is attached to the bulkhead with two screws with the end caps pointing in the waste bin.</p>

<p>The lavatory fire extinguisher has dual discharge outlets. It is a thermally actuated extinguisher with no electrical interface. If the end caps on the discharge tubes reach 174 °F (79 °C), the fusible alloy seals melt and release the end cap from the tubes. The extinguishing agent is then released into the waste bin.</p>
