<p><strong>Engine Fire Extinguisher Bottles</strong></p>


<p>Two dual port FIREX bottles are installed FWD and AFT in the left wing root, for engine fire suppression. Both bottles can be used to extinguish a fire in either engine.</p>

<p>The engine nacelle left and right extinguisher bottles can be discharged into the Primary Engine Zone (PEZ), Main Wheel Well (MWW) and Leading Edge Zone (LEZ) zones from the Fire Protection Panel (FPP). The left or right bottle squibs are armed by pulling the PULL FUEL/HYD OFF handle. After arming, the pilot can operate one of the extinguisher bottles with the EXTG switch on the FPP. An electrical signal is sent through the bridgewires, which ignites the Electroâˆ’Explosive Device (EED). When the EED explodes it ruptures a burst disc, and the pressurized bottle then discharges through the connector Check Tee.</p>

<p>The bottle configuration can give two applications of fire suppressant into the zones, in the event that the first attempt was not effective.</p>
