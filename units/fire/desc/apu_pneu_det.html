<p><strong>Advanced Pneumatic Detectors (APD)</strong></p>


<p>Advanced Pneumatic Detectors (APD) or fire detection loops are used to sense a fire or overheat condition in the nacelles.</p>

<p>APD’s have a main element body and sensor tube. The main element body is held in place by two P−clamps and the sensor tube is supported by additional clamps and grommets.</p>

<p>APD’s are sensor tubes filled with helium gas to monitor for fires. The helium gas is sensitive to changes in temperature; its pressure increases with the increase in temperature. Spot heat releases hydrogen from the central core which increases pressure in the loop.</p>

<p>Two switches in the APD − the integrity switch and the alarm switch − provide the fault and alarm signals. The fire or overheat condition is shown on the Fire Protection Panel (FPP).</p>

<p>The integrity switch monitors the pressure in the sensor element. If an APD breaks, the loss of pressure in the sensor will open the switch and turn on the FAULT A or FAULT B light on the FPP. The alarm switch is normally open, and closes when an overheat or fire condition occurs, caused by the gas pressure increase in the APD.</p>
