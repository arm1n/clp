<p><strong>FWD Baggage Smoke Detector</strong></p>


<P>The FWD Baggage Smoke Detector senses the presence of smoke in the forward baggage compartment.</P>

<P>The FWD baggage smoke detector is a self−contained open−area detector. It is a line replaceable unit (LRU) and is located in the forward baggage compartment. Electrical connections are provided using an external 66 pin connector, keyed to eliminate mismatching.</P>

<p>During a fire or smoke condition, the smoke detector produces an alarm, based on a predetermined trip set point. This causes the “SMOKE” indicator light on the Fire Protection Panel (FPP) to come on.</p>

<p>The smoke detector has a Built−In Test capability that completely tests its functionality in response to a test signal from the FPP.</p>
