<p><strong>Aft High Rate Fire Extinguisher Bottle</strong></p>

<p>The <b>Aft High Rate Fire Extinguisher Bottle</b> contains the suppressant necessary for first line fire protection.</p>

<p>The bottle is installed in the aft equipment bay. One high rate fire extinguisher cartridge is located on the bottom of the AFT high rate fire bottle.</p>

<p>If a smoke condition is sensed in the AFT baggage compartment, the AFT inlet and outlet vent valves will close automatically and give an indication on the FPP. The HRD extinguisher fires with the push of the AFT EXTG switch. After a seven minute delay, the low rate fire extinguisher will automatically discharge to make sure the fire is out.</p>
