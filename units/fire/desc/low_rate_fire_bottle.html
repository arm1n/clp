<p><strong>Low Rate Fire Extinguisher Bottle</strong></p>


<p>The Low Rate Fire Extinguisher Bottle contains the suppressant necessary for slow release.</p>

<p>The bottle is installed in the aft equipment bay, but is shared between the FWD and AFT baggage compartments.</p>

<p>When a smoke condition is sensed in the AFT baggage compartment and the aft <b>High−Rate fire bottle</b> is activated, the <b>Low−Rate fire extinguisher</b> will automatically discharge after <b>seven minutes</b>. A metering device located inside the low rate fire extinguisher controls the slow release of the extinguishing agent from the bottle. This device lets the bottle discharge the extinguishing agent into the baggage compartment at a concentration of 3% for 45 minutes.</p>

<p>If a smoke condition is sensed in the FWD baggage compartment, both the High−Rate <b>and</b> the Low−Rate fire extinguishers will discharge at the same time.</p>
