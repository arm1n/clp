<p><strong>Steering manifold</strong></p>

<p>The steering manifold is installed on the right front side of the outer cylinder of the NLG. It receives electrical signals from the SCU and converts the signals to supply hydraulic pressure to the hydraulic motor to steer the nosewheels. The steering manifold sends nosewheel position signals to the SCU to keep the nosewheels in the commanded steering position.</p>
