<p><strong>Main wheel brake unit</strong></p>

<p>Two brake units are installed on each axle of the main landing gear. The brake pins on the MLG shock strut engage with the bushings in the piston housing assembly to transfer the braking loads to the landing gear. The main wheel brake unit is a piston operated, carbon heat sink, multiple carbon disk brake.</p>
<p>Two wear indicator pins are attached to the pressure plate assembly and extend out of the piston housing to give an indication of brake wear. When the wear pin is level with the wear indicator sleeve, replacement of the MLG brake unit is required.</p>
