<p><strong>Main landing gear Stabilizer Brace</strong></p>

<p>The stabilizer brace is a two piece folding structural component. The stabilizer brace keeps the yoke and the shock strut in position when the MLG is in the extended or retracted position.</p>
<p>The forward section of the stabilizer brace is attached to the airframe structure in the forward section of the wheelwell and the aft section of the stabilizer brace is attached to the yoke.</p>
<p>The stabilizer brace has an overcenter link subassembly attached between the two sections of the stabilizer brace. The overcenter link subassembly supplies a mechanical lock for the MLG in the down position. The mechanical lock is broken by the lock actuator. Two lock springs keep the links in the mechanical lock position.</p>
<p>The lock springs lock the stabilizer brace in the down position when the alternate extension system is in operation. The stabilizer brace has provision for the installation of a ground lock pin when the MLG
is extended.</p>
