<p><strong>Nose landing gear door mechanism</strong></p>

<p>The NLG doors mechanism is actuated by the NLG door actuator to open or close the forward NLG doors.</p>
<p>When the NLG doors actuator retracts, it unlocks the over centered lock link. As the actuator continues to retract, it folds the lock link and turns the bellcrank clockwise. The bellcrank acting on the two push rods pushes the forward doors to the open position.</p>
<p>When the NLG doors actuator extends, it unfolds the lock link to the over−center position. As the actuator continues to extend, it unfolds the lock link and turns the bellcrank anti−clockwise. The bellcrank acting on the two push rods, pulls the forward doors to the closed position.</p>
<p>The forward doors are closed when the NLG is in the extended or the retracted position.</p>
