<p><strong>NOSE GEAR LOCK Proximity Sensors</strong></p>

<p>Two proximity sensors monitor the NLG position status. One sensor senses if the landing gear is <strong>DOWN</strong>, and the other one senses if the landing gear is <strong>Locked</strong>. You can lock the nose gear in the extended or the retracted position. If the sensors show that the nose gear is in the down and locked position, then the green <strong>“SAFE”</strong> light, on the LGCIP, will come on. This will occur regardless of the position of the Landing Gear Control Handle.</p>

<p>However, if the handle is in the Extend position and the nose gear is not <strong>DOWN AND LOCKED</strong>, the red <strong>“UNSAFE”</strong> light on the LGCIP will come on.</p>
 
<p>If the Landing Gear Handle is in the Retract position and the sensors show that the gear is not <strong>UP AND LOCKED</strong>, the red <strong>“UNSAFE”</strong> light will come on.</p>
