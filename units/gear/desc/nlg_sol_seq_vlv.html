<p><strong>NLG Doors Solenoid Sequence Valve</strong></p>

<p>The NLG doors solenoid sequence valve is a boltâˆ’on assembly with four ports. The valve is directly operated by a single coil solenoid. This valve lets the hydraulically operated NLG wheelwell doors open and close.</p>

<p>The solenoid selector valve stays powered to allow for continued hydraulic pressure acting on the gear when down and locked, however primary downlock is by the overcenter locks.</p>

<p>If a landing gear hydraulic sequencing valve fails, or the PSEU is unable to control it, the LDG GEAR INOP caution light comes on.</p>
