<p><strong>NLG WOW Proximity Sensors</strong></p>


<p>For the landing gear to retract, the PSEU must get an air mode signal and the NLG proximity sensor must read NEAR (NWCENT NEAR).</p>

<p>After take−off the PSEU sends the “WOW OFF” signal to the SCU. The SCU ignores the pilot input and enters a ”straight ahead mode”. Then the SCU energizes the EHSV in the steering manifold and actuates the hydraulic motor to center the nose gear. When the SCU senses the nose gear is at the neutral position through two RVDTs located at the top of the steering gearbox, the hydraulic motor stops. When the centering actuator rod is fully extended in the detent, the nosewheels are in the center position. The PSEU then lets the landing−gear retraction sequence start when the landing−gear handle is moved to the UP position.</p>
