<p><strong>Towing of the Aircraft</strong></p>

<p>Before you connect the tow bar to the aircraft make sure that the nosewheel steering switch is set to the off position and stays off during towing. </p>

<p>Engage the ground lock of the nose landing gear</p>	
	
<p>Install the lock pins in the main landing gear</p>
	
<p>After towing, make sure the nosewheel is centered before you disconnect the towbar. If you do not do this, you can cause injuries to persons and/or damage to the equipment.</p>
