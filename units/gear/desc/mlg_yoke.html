<p><strong>Main landing gear yoke</strong></p>

<p>The yoke assembly is an Hâˆ’shaped structural component that connects the upper end of the shock strut to the airframe structure in the aft section of the wheelwell.</p>
<p>A stabilizer brace keeps the yoke in position in the wheelwell.
The retraction actuator cylinder attaches to the cross beam of the yoke with two lubricated hinge points. The rod end of the auxiliary retraction actuator is attached to lugs at the top of the yoke with lubricated hinge points.</p>
<p>The yoke rotates about the top hinge points and the bottom of the yoke moves forward in the wheelwell during the retraction sequence.</p>
