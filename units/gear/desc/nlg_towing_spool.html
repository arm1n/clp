<p><strong>Towing spool</strong></p>

<p>The spools are on the inner cylinder of the nose landing gear at the suspension lever pivot point and used to connect a towing bar and tow the aircraft with a towing vehicle.</p>
<p>For Information: Before you connect the tow bar to the aircraft make sure that the nosewheel steering switch is set to the off position and stays off during towing. After towing, make sure the nosewheel is centered before you disconnect the towbar.</p>
