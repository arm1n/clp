<p><strong>Alternate Landing Gear Selector Valve</strong></p>

<p>The LANDING GEAR ALTERNATE EXTENSION door, on the flight compartment floor, must then be fully opened giving access to the alternate extension handpump and the NOSE L/G RELEASE handle. The door operates the alternate landing gear selector valve and reveals the handpump socket.</p>

<p>When the NOSE L/G RELEASE handle is pulled, the nose gear uplock and doors are released and the nose gear free falls to a down and locked position, assisted by the airflow.</p>
