<p><strong>NLG Doors Mechanical Sequence Valve</strong></p>

<p>The NLG mechanical sequence valve is a bolt-on assembly. It correctly sequences the NLG uplock/downlock release and the NLG retraction actuators. This prevents the landing gear from traveling through partially opened NLG landing gear doors.</p>

<p>The NLG mechanical sequence valve is open when the landing gear is moving between either the fully extended or the fully retracted position. The NLG mechanical sequence valve is closed when the landing gear is locked in either the fully extended or the fully retracted position.</p>
