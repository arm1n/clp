<p><strong>Main landing gear wheel assembly</strong></p>

<p>The main wheels are a split-web type assembly made of two forged aluminum wheel halves. There are two different wheel assemblies 
that can be used on the main landing gear. One main wheel assembly has a 32°-8.8-16, 18 ply tubeless tire. The other main wheel assembly 
has a 34°-10.75-16, 16 ply tubeless tire.</p>

<p>Tapered wheel bearings and bearing cups are installed in the inner and outer wheel halves.</p>

<p>An inflation valve assembly is installed in the outer wheel half assembly. An over inflation plug is installed 180 degrees from the inflation valve to prevent over inflation of the tire. The over inflation plug contains a disk that ruptures, and deflates the tire to zero pressure. </p>

<p>Four thermal relief plugs are installed in the web of the inner wheel half. Each thermal relief plug is made of fusible metal that melts at a 
specified temperature. This will release the pressure in the tire and prevent an explosion if the wheel gets too hot.</p>

<p>Wheel inserts are installed on the inner wheel. The inserts engage the drive slots in the brake disks of the main wheel brake units, which 
turn the disks when the wheel turns.</p>
