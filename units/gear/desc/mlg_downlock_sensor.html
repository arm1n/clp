<p><b>MLG  DOWNLOCK Proximity Sensor</b></p>

<p>One (primary) sensor monitors the left and right landing gear to make sure of the landing gear’s downlock status. Whenever a downlock proximity sensor senses a target NEAR condition, a green “safe” light comes on for that landing gear. These lights come on only when the landing gear is down and locked. You can find the left (sensor S07, LGDLK1) and right (sensor S13, RGDLK1) sensors, for the landing gear down lock status, on the stabilizer brace lock link assembly.</p>
