<p><strong>PROXIMITY SENSOR SYSTEM</strong></p>

<br>
<p><b>Sensors and Targets</b></p>
<p>The proximity sensors are stable conductors. The inductance of a sensor changes when the ferromagnetic stainless steel target comes near. Each sensor is connected to a sensor circuit in the PSEU. The sensor circuit is switched on when the inductance of the sensor increases to the switch point. This occurs when the target is brought within approximately 0.050 inch (1.27 millimeter) from the sensor face. This is a target "near" condition. This is a target "near" condition. The reverse occurs when the target is taken away, a target "far" condition. The PSEU logic circuits operate from the "near" or "far" switching signals.</p>


<p>The Proximity Sensor System (PSS) is a part of the landing gear system. The system gives:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Landing Gear Control (LGC)</li>
	<li>Landing Gear status Indication (LGI)</li>
	<li>Alternate Downlock Indication (ADI)</li>
	<li>Weight−On−Wheels indication (WOW1 and WOW2)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Proximity Sensor System (PSS) has a Proximity Sensor Electronics Unit (PSEU) and proximity sensors.
</p>
<p>The PSS uses 20 proximity sensors to give the position of the landing gear and the gear doors.</p>

<p>The outputs of the sensors are processed by the PSEU. They also show the position of the landing gear
	components, aircraft on ground and gear doors.
