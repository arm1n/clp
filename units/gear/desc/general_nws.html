<p><strong>NOSEWHEEL STEERING</strong></p>

<p>Nosewheel steering is by the steering tiller or the rudder pedals when the steering switch is set to STEERING. The steering tiller is a self centering unit that lets the pilot steer the nosewheels for forward taxi at low speed. The steering tiller is installed in the flight compartment on the pilot’s left side console . The steering tiller gives full authority steering command signals of the nosewheel position to the Steering Control Unit (SCU). It can steer the nosewheels ±70 degrees to the left and right of the center position.</p>

<p>The rudder pedals are self centering and allow the crew to steer the nosewheels for high speed taxi, take off, and landing purposes. The rudder pedals can steer the nosewheels to a maximum of ±8 degrees left and right of the center position. The potentiometer for the rudder pedals is installed on the support structure of the control quadrant of the rudder system. A linkage assembly connects the potentiometer to the control quadrant of the rudder system. The potentiometer gives limited authority steering command signals of the nosewheel position to the SCU.</p>
