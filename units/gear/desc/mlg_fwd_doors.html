<p><strong>Main landing gear fwd doors</strong></p>

<p>The forward doors are double skinned and are made in the same shape as the bottom contour of the center section of the engine nacelle. The doors are connected to the bottom of the center section of the engine nacelle by hinges. The doors are symmetrical and meet at the engine nacelle centerline when closed. </p>
<p>The forward doors are operated by mechanical links attached to the drag strut of the MLG.
When the MLG is extended the forward doors are opened mechanically. When the MLG is retracted the doors are closed mechanically.</p>
