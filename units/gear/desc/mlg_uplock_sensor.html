<p><b>MLG UPLOCK Proximity Sensor</b></p>

<p>One (primary) sensor monitors the left and right landing gear to make sure of the landing gear’s uplock status. You can find the left (sensor S15, LGUPLK1) and right (sensor S16, RGUPLK1) sensors, for the landing gear uplock status, on the uplock assembly. There is one sensor for each set of gear. During the normal extension sequence, if one of the three gear “safe” lights are not on, the Alternate Downlock Indication is consulted. Or if one of the three gear “unsafe” lights come on, the Alternate Downlock Indication is consulted.</p>
