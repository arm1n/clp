<p><strong>Fuse/Shuttle Valve</strong></p>

<p>
There are four fuse/shuttle valves installed on the left wall of the left and the right nacelles.</p>
<p>Hydraulic pressure is supplied from the No.1 hydraulic system to the brake units through the skid control valves and the fuse/shuttle valves.</p>
<p>The fuse component of the fuse/shuttle valve closes the hydraulic line to the brake unit, if the fluid flow is more than a specified quantity. This will limit the leakage of hydraulic fluid if a brake line on the main landing gear is cut or if a brake unit develops a leak.</p>
<p>The shuttle component of the fuse/shuttle valve allows either normal brake pressure or parking/emergency brake pressure to be used to actuate the brake units.</p>
