<p><strong>Main Landing Gear Mechanical Sequence Valve</strong></p>

<p>The MLG mechanical sequence valve is a boltâˆ’on assembly. During landing gear retraction and extension, the mechanical sequence valve operates to correctly sequence the MLG uplock release and the MLG retraction actuators. This prevents the landing gear from traveling through partially opened MLG landing gear doors.</p>
