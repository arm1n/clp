<p><strong>Nose wheel steering control unit</strong></p>

<p>
The steering system is electronically controlled by the Steering Control Unit (SCU). The SCU does built−in−test and diagnostic functions on the components of the steering system.</p>
<p>The SCU is an electronic box installed on the outer side of the Nose Landing Gear (NLG) wheelwell wall. Access to the SCU in the equipment bay of the forward nose fuselage is through a panel on the right side of the nose fuselage.</p>
<p>
The SCU uses input commands from the steering tiller, the rudder pedals, and the Proximity Sensor Electronic Unit (PSEU). Input signals are received from the STEERING switch, the steering manifold, and the Rotary Variable Differential Transformers (RVDT).</p>
<p>The SCU supplies output commands to the steering manifold and gives failure signals to the CAUTION and WARNING panel.</p>
