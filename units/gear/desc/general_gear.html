<p><strong>Landing Gear</strong></p>

<p>Each main gear has a pair of forward and aft doors hinged to the nacelle side structure. When the gear is up, all doors enclose the main wheels. With the main gear down, the forward door on each main gear stays open.</p>

<p>The Proximity Switch Electronic Unit (PSEU) controls the landing gear and hydraulically operated gear doors and related advisory lights, and monitors proximity and Weight−On−Wheels (WOW) sensors. WOW signals prevent gear retraction while on the ground. Failure of a WOW sensor turns on a WT ON WHEELS caution light. Redundancy is built in to ensure landing gear operation if there is a failure.</p>

<p>An audible warning tone sounds, when the gear is not down and locked and the aircraft is in a landing configuration.</p>

<p>Ground lock pins are supplied for the main gear and an integral ground lock mechanism is controlled from outside the aircraft for locking the nose gear. The main gear lock−pins may be kept in the forward compartment of the forward passenger door. With the gear extended, the pins are inserted into the main gear stabilizer brace assemblies. There are also landing gear door lock pins for the nose and main hydraulic doors. These prevent the hydraulic gear doors from closing.</p>
