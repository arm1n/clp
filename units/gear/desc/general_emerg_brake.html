<p><strong>Emergency Brake System</strong></p>

<p>The emergency/parking brake system lets the brakes be applied if the normal brake system fails, or for setting the parking brake. An EMERG BRAKE lever on the Engine Control quadrant operates the system. The emergency/parking brake system is powered by No. 2 hydraulic system, or by parking brake accumulator pressure. Hydraulic pressure to the emergency/parking brake system is shown on the PK BRK indicator on the Permanent Systems Area (PSA) of the Multi Function Display (MFD).</p>

<p>The parking brake is engaged by pulling the EMERG BRAKE lever all the way back to the detent PARK position. This turns on the PARKING BRAKE caution light on the caution and warning panel.</p>




<p>With the parking brake set, application of engine power will cause the takeâˆ’off warning horn to sound.</p>

<p>A hand pump located in the right main wheel well can be used to increase the park/brake accumulator pressure. Minimum pressure required for setting the park brake is 1,500 psi (10342 kPa).</p>
