<p><strong>Normal Braking System</strong></p>

<p>Each main wheel is equipped with a multiple disc brake unit powered by the No. 1 hydraulic system . An Anti Skid Control Unit (ASCU) modulates the application of brake pressure to each brake unit. Brake pressure is applied by pushing the pilot’s or copilot’s brake pedals.</p>

<p>The anti skid control unit has the functions that follow:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Monitors wheel speed</li>
	<li>Modulates the brake pressure applied to each brake unit to prevent wheel lock-up</li>
	<li>Gives maximum braking at all levels of runway friction</li>
</ul>
