<p><strong>Extension bypass valve</strong></p>

<p>The bypass valve is installed in the forward right wing root area, adjacent to the landing gear selector valve.</p>
<p>
The bypass valve isolates the No. 2 hydraulic supply lines from the main and nose gear retraction actuators, and connects the lines to the return lines.</p>
<p>The bypass valve is actuated when the LANDING GEAR ALTERNATE RELEASE door is opened. Cables extend from the LANDING GEAR ALTERNATE RELEASE door and attach to a lever at the bypass valve. The lever operates the bypass valve.</p>
