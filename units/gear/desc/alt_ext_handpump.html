<p><strong>Nose landing gear alternate release handle</strong></p>

<p>The LANDING GEAR ALTERNATE EXTENSION door, on the flight compartment floor, must then be fully opened giving access to the alternate extension handpump and the NOSE L/G RELEASE handle. Opening the door mechanically operates the NLG alternate selector valve</p>
<p>When the NOSE L/G RELEASE handle is pulled, the nose gear uplock and doors are released and the nose gear free falls to a down and locked position, assisted by the airflow.</p>
