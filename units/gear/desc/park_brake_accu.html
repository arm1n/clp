<p><strong>Parking brake accumulator</strong></p>

<p>If the emergency/parking brake system is used with No. 2 hydraulic system inoperative, the accumulator supplies brake pressure.</p>
<p>
The accumulator is pressurized with nitrogen on one side of the internal piston and hydraulic fluid on the other side.</p>
<p>The gas side of the accumulator is preâˆ’charged to 500 psi. The fluid side is pressurized by the No.2 hydraulic system or the handpump.
</p>
<p>
Pumping the brakes with the EMERG BRAKE lever will rapidly decrease the remaining accumulator brake pressure; therefore brakes should be applied with a steady continuous pressure.</p>
<p>A fully charged accumulator is sufficient for approximately four full applications.</p>
