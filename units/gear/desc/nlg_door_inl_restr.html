<p><strong>NLG Doors Inline Restrictor</strong></p>

<p>The NLG inline restrictors are unions that provide a specific hydraulic restriction. The NLG inline restrictors bypass the NLG mechanical sequence valves to keep the NLG retraction actuators pressurized to 3000 psi (20684 kPa). Hydraulic pressure is kept at 3000 psi (20684 kPa) upon completion of the retraction cycle.</p>
