<p><strong>Nose landing gear wheel assembly</strong></p>

<p>The nosewheels are a split−web type assembly made of two forged aluminum wheel halves. Each nosewheel has a 22°—6.50–10, 8 ply tubeless tire.</p>
<p>Tapered wheel bearings and bearing cups are installed in the inner and outer wheel halves.</p>
<p>An inflation valve assembly is installed in the outer wheel half assembly. An overinflation plug is installed in the outer wheel half assembly to prevent overinflation of the tire. The plug contains a disk that ruptures, and deflates the tire to zero pressure.</p>
