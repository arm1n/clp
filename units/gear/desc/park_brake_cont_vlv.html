<p><strong>Parking brake control valve</strong></p>

<p>The parking brake control valve is installed in the right wing root area and is operated by the parking brake control cable.</p>
<p>The No.2 hydraulic system pressure is supplied to the parking brake control valve. From the control valve, pressure is metered to the fuse/shuttle valves and the brake units in proportion to the amount of parking brake lever movement. This lets the pilot apply proportional braking pressure through the park/emergency brake system when the normal braking system has failed.</p>
<p>When the parking brake lever is moved from the stowed to the PARK position, full hydraulic pressure is applied to the four brake units. A pressure transducer in the parking brake control valve supplies a signal to the flight compartment indication system to indicate the hydraulic pressure in the parking brake system.</p>
<p>The parking brake control valve has a relief valve to prevent an over pressure condition when the handpump is used to pressurize the system. Two check valves are contained in the brake control valve housing. These valves are used to isolate the No.2 hydraulic system and the handpump from the parking brake system.</p>
