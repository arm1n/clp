<p><strong>Nose landing gear electrical harness</strong></p>

<p>Four electrical harnesses are attached at different places on the shock strut. Two additional electrical harnesses are attached to the drag strut.</p>

<p>The four harnesses on the shock strut give power/signal input for the components that follow:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The taxi light</li>
	<li>The WOW proximity sensors</li>
	<li>The steering proximity sensor</li>
	<li>The steering manifold pressure switches</li>
	<li>The Rotary Variable Differential Transformers (RVDTs)</li>
</ul>

<p>The two harnesses on the drag strut supply electrical power/signal input for the primary and alternate lock proximity sensors.</p>
