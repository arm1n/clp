<p><strong>Main landing gear shock strut</strong></p>

<p>The shock strut outer cylinder is a Y−shaped component with a single stage nitrogen and oil filled shock absorbing piston fitted inside the outer cylinder.</p>
<p>The anti−skid devices, brake units, and wheel assemblies are attached to a removable and interchangeable axle at the bottom of the shock strut piston. An uplock roller on the back of the outer cylinder engages the uplock assembly in the aft section of the wheelwell to lock the MLG in the retracted position.</p>
<p>The shock strut is held in position, in the wheelwell, by the drag strut.</p>
