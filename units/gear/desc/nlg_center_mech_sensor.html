<p><strong>NLG Centering Mechanism Prox. Sensor</strong></p>


<p>The proximity sensor sends a signal to the PSEU when the centering actuator is in the straight ahead detent of the machined race.For the landing gear to retract, the PSEU must get an air mode signal and the NLG proximity sensor must read NEAR (NWCENT NEAR).</p>


<clp-text-blue><strong>NOTE:</strong></clp-text-blue>
<p>PSEU requires the NWCENT proximity sensor to read NEAR before retraction. Any discrepancy or miss alignment of the RVDTâ€™s will make the nose wheel steering hydraulics stop before the NLG has reached center position. This will give a NWCENT UNREASONABLE FAR condition.</p>
