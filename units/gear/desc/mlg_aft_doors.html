<p><strong>Main landing gear aft doors</strong></p>

<p>The aft doors are double skinned and are made in the same shape as the bottom contour of the aft section of the engine nacelle. The doors are connected to the bottom of the aft section of the engine nacelle by hinges.</p>
<p>Two doors close off the aft section of the MLG wheelwell. The aft doors are closed when the MLG is retracted and closed when the MLG is extended.
</p>
<p>The aft doors are opened and closed by a single hydraulic actuator and a linkage mechanism.</p>
<p>
An alternate release arm is used to open the doors during alternate extension of the MLG. The status of the aft doors is shown on the LANDING CONTROL panel in the flight compartment.</p>
