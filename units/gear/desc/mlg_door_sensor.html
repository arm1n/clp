<p><strong>GEAR DOORS CLOSED Proximity Sensor</strong></p>

<p>A proximity sensor is installed on the left side of the aft section of the wheelwell. The proximity sensor sends a signal to the Proximity Sensor Electronic Unit (PSEU). The PSEU sends a signal to the LANDING GEAR control panel, located in the flight compartment, to show the status of the aft doors.</p>
<p>When the doors are open the amber L.DOOR and R.DOOR lights come on. The lock links in an overcenter position will show that the doors are closed and locked, and the lights will go off. </p>
