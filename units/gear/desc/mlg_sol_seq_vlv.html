<p><strong>Main Landing Gear Solenoid Sequence Valve</strong></p>

<p>The MLG mechanical sequence valve is a boltâˆ’on assembly. During landing gear retraction and extension, the mechanical sequence valve operates to correctly sequence the MLG uplock release and the MLG retraction actuators. This prevents the landing gear from traveling through partially opened MLG landing gear doors.</p>


<p>The solenoid selector valve stays powered to allow for continued hydraulic pressure acting on the gear when down and locked, however primary downlock is by the overcenter locks.</p>

<p>If a landing gear hydraulic sequencing valve fails, or the PSEU is unable to control it, the LDG GEAR INOP caution light comes on.</p>
