<p><strong>Rudder Pedal Potentiometer</strong></p>

<p>The rudder pedals are self centering and allow the crew to steer the nosewheels for high speed taxi, take−off, and landing purposes. The rudder pedals can steer the nosewheels to a maximum of ±8 degrees left and right of the center position.</p>
<p>
The potentiometer for the rudder pedals is installed on the support structure of the control quadrant of the rudder system. A linkage assembly connects the potentiometer to the control quadrant of the rudder system. The potentiometer gives limited authority steering command signals of the 
nosewheel position to the SCU.</p>
