<p><strong>Alternate extension control cables</strong></p>

<p>The MLG ALTERNATE RELEASE door installed in the flight compartment ceiling has a closed loop cable system.</p>
<p>When the door is opened, it actuates the bypass valve to the BYPASS position. This isolates the main landing gear hydraulic system and depressurizes the extension actuators. It also lets the MLG be pumped to the down and locked position.</p>
<p>When the door is closed, the bypass valve returns to the NORMAL position.</p>
<p>Control cables are routed from the MLG alternate release handle through a slider mechanism located in the ceiling of the aircraft forward of the wing root. From here, the control cables are routed through to the engine nacelles to the cam mechanisms. The cam mechanism allows the force of the pull to be concentrated first on the release of the MLG aft doors and then on the MLG.</p>
<p>Control cables are routed from the NLG alternate release handle through a pulley cam mechanism located in the forward fuselage above the nose wheel well. The pulley cam mechanism lets the full force of the pull be concentrated first on the release of the NLG forward doors and then on the NLG.</p>
