<p><strong>NLG alternate extension</strong></p>

<p>The alternate extension of the NLG uses the NLG alternate release handle located in the floor of the flight compartment under the LANDING GEAR ALTERNATE EXTENSION door.</p>
<p>The handle is connected by cables, turnbuckles and pulleys to the NLG uplock release arm, a pulley cam mechanism and to the NLG door release operating arm. The pulley cam mechanism makes sure that the NLGÂ forward doors open before the NLG uplock is opened to release the NLG.</p>
