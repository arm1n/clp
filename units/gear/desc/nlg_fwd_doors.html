<p><strong>Nose landing gear forward doors</strong></p>

<p>The two NLG forward doors are hinged to the fuselage at two places. The forward hinges form the attachment brackets for the operating mechanism.</p>
<p>The operating mechanism has two adjustable connecting rods, an extension spring, a bellcrank, a toggle link assembly, a link assembly, a mechanical sequence valve, and a hydraulic actuator. This operating mechanism is attached to the forward wall of the nosewheel bay and is protected by a removable debris guard.</p>
<p>Each door is made up of an inner skin and an outer skin. The inner skin is contoured to give clearance for the nosewheels in the retracted position.</p>
