<p><strong>MLG Proximity Sensors</strong></p>

<p><b>DOWNLOCK SENSOR</b></p>
<p>One (primary) sensor monitors the left and right landing gear to make sure of the landing gear’s downlock status. Whenever a downlock proximity sensor senses a target NEAR condition, a green “safe” light comes on for that landing gear. These lights come on only when the landing gear is down and locked. You can find the left (sensor S07, LGDLK1) and right (sensor S13, RGDLK1) sensors, for the landing gear down lock status, on the stabilizer brace lock link assembly.</p>

<p><b>UPLOCK SENSOR</b></p>
<p>One (primary) sensor monitors the left and right landing gear to make sure of the landing gear’s uplock status. You can find the left (sensor S15, LGUPLK1) and right (sensor S16, RGUPLK1) sensors, for the landing gear uplock status, on the uplock assembly. There is one sensor for each set of gear. During the normal extension sequence, if one of the three gear “safe” lights are not on, the Alternate Downlock Indication is consulted. Or if one of the three gear “unsafe” lights come on, the Alternate Downlock Indication is consulted.</p>
